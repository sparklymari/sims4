The <b>Simple Life, Simple Death Podium</b> houses many Funeral interactions that a Sim might like to complete during the event.\n\nThe <b>Burial Casket</b> and <b>Gravesite</b> objects can store Sim remains, so feel free to drag a Deceased Sim's Urn from a Sim's Inventory to the floor or ground, and then into either of these objects. These objects also allow for Funeral interactions to be performed by selecting the Urn or Gravestone inside. To view the Urn inside the Burial Casket, select <b>Open</b>.\n\nPlace a <b>Memorial Display</b> and <b>Memorial Portrait</b> and dedicate it to the deceased. If you would like a more celebratory event, place the <b>Memorial Cannon</b> to give the Sim the most epic send off!\n\nAlthough Guest Sims will grieve freely during a Funeral, interactions like <b>Call Over Guests</b> can help bring attention to certain activities that you would like to complete. <b>Funeral Activities and Interactions</b> can be found by selecting <b>Sims</b>, the <b>Funeral Podium</b>, and the <b>Urn or Gravestone</b> while a Funeral is in session.--></T>
