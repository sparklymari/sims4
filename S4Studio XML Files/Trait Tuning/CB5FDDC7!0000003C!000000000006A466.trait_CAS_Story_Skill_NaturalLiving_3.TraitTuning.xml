  <T n="trait_description">0x3CAC5B68<!--Embrace the bohemian life with this Skill that erases the boundary between "in here" and "out there." Sims can start by sleeping outdoors, doing basic Foraging, and bathing in rivers, lakes, oceans, and even ponds. With practice, Sims unlock ways to solve any and all their Needs naturally. High-skilled Sims may choose to live without a bed, kitchen, bathroom, or even any house at all. Natural Living is more than just surviving, it's thrivingâ€”whether travelling out in the world or bedding down on the grass in your own beautiful garden!\n\nNatural Living is improved best by first hand practice outdoors but can also be studied at the Computer or by reading a Natural Living Skill Book.--></T>
