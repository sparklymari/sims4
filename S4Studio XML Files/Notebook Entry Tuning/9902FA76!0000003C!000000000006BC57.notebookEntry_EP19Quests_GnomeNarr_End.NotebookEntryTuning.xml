So during the day, he decided to stay and clean up the house - make it shine! But after an hour, he took a long shower, and stated the mess should be fine. Then deep in the night, from sparkle or might, the house was made all neat and clean. And when they awoke, that syrupy bloke took credit for scrubbing the scene.\n\nThis went on for days, he got so much praise, their marriage had started to mend. But cake-man was skeptic, this ruse felt so hectic, he needed the mystery to end. He snuck down at nightfall, to see fairies so small, zapping his kitchen pristine. So he left them a snack, grilled cheese for the hack, for buttering up his dear queen.\n\nThis Fable was completed by uncovering Sim's belief in Fairies.--></T>
