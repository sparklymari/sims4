Now this place was made for all of life’s creatures, but nobody knew its true worth. Except Mother Nature, and her nomenclature, which stated “it’s deep in the earth”. So go my dear friend, figure out what she means, and catch your reward if you dare. You can teleport, the travel is short, then find out what’s hidden in there.\n\nA beautiful scene, fairies flutter and flee, but nothing seems like a big deal. I’m sure if you knew, you’d get Mother’s clue, and maybe that thing would be real. So it’s probably better to not know it was dirt - the thing you were trying to cash. To Mother it’s treasure, it brings her great pleasure, though most Sims would deem it was trash.\n\nThis Fable was completed by catching a Treefish in Sylvan Glade.--></T>
