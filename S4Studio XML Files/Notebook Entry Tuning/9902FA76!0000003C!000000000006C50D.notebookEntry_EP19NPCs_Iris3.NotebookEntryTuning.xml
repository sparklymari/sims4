I think I came out here to find a way to fix myself, but I've learned there's nothing wrong with me. I'm not ailing or unlucky. My true nature is nurturing others, and I can find that joy in so many other ways. My friends, my job, even my family. I shouldn't have shut them out, but I needed to find acceptance on my own. Now that I have, I'm ready to let them smother me again in all the best ways.--></T>
