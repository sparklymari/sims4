<b>Effects:</b> Helps Vampire Sims feel happy and refreshed. Non-Vampires should avoid. If Nectar is at least Lightly Aged, Vampire refreshment greatly increases. A happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off.
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and negative effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
