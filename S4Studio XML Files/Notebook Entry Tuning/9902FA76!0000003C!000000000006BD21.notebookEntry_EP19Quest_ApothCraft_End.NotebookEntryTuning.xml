This natural lifestyle is one that they’ve earned, building strength to survive on the knoll. But hey, have you heard? Of the old urban legend? The one where the worms take control!\n\nSee foraging, sleeping, a pond bath or two - could be any entry to danger. You start out all normal, but after some time, your system is filled with this stranger! Once stuffed to the brim with these wiggly friends, a Sim will start to transform. Their body composed, both inside and out, of worms will be their new norm. And should this occur, it’s best to be kind, reassure, compliment, and affirm. The most vital answer will be to the question “Do you still love me as a worm?”\n\nThis Fable was completed by foraging for the Apothecary Vendor.--></T>
