This chicken was caught, in a moment of thought, watching Sims try out some composting. <i>“I’ll bet you a grand, if you can withstand, competitive social trash-posting.”</i> The chick said “For sure!”, they knew they’d endure, for their beak was good with collision. But to prevent damage, the chicken must manage a slow ‘n steady disposition.\n\nThe bunny was faster, a social post master, and chickie was taking her time. But like a true flake, bunny needed a break, leaving chicken alone in her prime. Not long and with luck, the chicken had snuck, past the bunny’s number of submissions. And with her small speed, the posts to her feed, had won her the contest’s conditions. The bunny was stunned that the chicken out-punned an expert like her in this race. But the chicken was proud, and stated aloud, <i>“Well, isn’t the egg on your face”!</i>\n\nThis Fable was completed by helping the Trader.--></T>
