Take a Lightning Root, for example. You might think, "Hey, they're just plants that shock you," and you'd be wrong. They feel like the rest of us. Pinch a leaf the wrong way, and you're going to get zapped. I mean, I wouldn't want my leaves pinched. But at the end of the day, they have such electric personalities despite being so sensitive.--></T>
