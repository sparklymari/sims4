<b>Effects:</b> Helps Sims feel <i>especially</i> happy, or the opposite if they overdo it. If Nectar is at least Lightly Aged, the consequences of overdoing it are significantly reduced. A happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off. (Unless Sim overdid it, then all bets are off.)
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and adverse effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
