    <T n="enabled">0x4B4D445C<!--Two gardens sat fine, across the yard line, of two neighbors who varied in skill. One garden grew tall, with crops ready for fall, and the other was withered and ill. Now that neighbor in need, did not care to weed, and put all the blame on the other. And the cause of their doubt, to the garden’s clear drought, were pixies that came in to smother.\n\nThey must have been drawn, towards the neighboring lawn, after soaking up all of the dust. But no pixies were present at this garden so pleasant, so the neighbor’s big lie was a bust. Yet still they denied that their garden had died from their fatal lack of care. All of their hard work was something to shirk, and come winter their pantry was bare.\n\nThis Fable was completed by delivering goods to the Mystical Fairy.--></T>
