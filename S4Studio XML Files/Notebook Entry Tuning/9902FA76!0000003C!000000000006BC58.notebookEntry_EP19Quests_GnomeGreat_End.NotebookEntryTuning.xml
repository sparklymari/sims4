The children came quick, for the Gnome they had kicked had locked himself far from their feet. But due to the walls, his plants he enthralled, had withered and died from no heat. So could such a Sim, hear a simple man’s whim, to waken the beast from within? I’ll send you along, you won’t need a song. Just simply show them compassion.\n\nHuzzah, He awakes! What magic he makes! Enchanted and lively, our savior! And should you come yell, he might cast a spell, to reward you if you’re in his favor. His heart you did free, and the Gnomes cheer with glee! You’ve awakened what once was asleep. Now off you go, you have much more to know, the lore of this tale runs so deep.\n\nThis Fable was completed by waking The Great Gnome.--></T>
