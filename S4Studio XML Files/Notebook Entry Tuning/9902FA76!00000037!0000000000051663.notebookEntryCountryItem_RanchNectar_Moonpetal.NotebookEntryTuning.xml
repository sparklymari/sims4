<b>Effects:</b> Helps Sims feel happy. Werewolves may enjoy an increased sense of calm. Beware: Any Werewolf who drinks too much will surely struggle to maintain control... If Nectar is at least Lightly Aged, calming effect for Werewolves increases. A happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off.
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and negative effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
