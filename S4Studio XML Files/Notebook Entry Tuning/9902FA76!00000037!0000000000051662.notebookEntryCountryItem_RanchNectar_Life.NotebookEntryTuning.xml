<b>Effects:</b> Helps Sims feel happy. Extends vitality for the living by a little, and for the dead by a lot. If Nectar is at least Lightly Aged, Sims get a bit more vitality and a happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off.
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and negative effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
  <T n="entry_text_flavor">0x1B558D53<!--This "beverage," if it can even be called that, is not so much a culinary invention as a bizarre alchemical joke: the overwhelming crush of death itself, flipped upside down by the humble spinach. It goes to show that the right skill and ingredients can turn an end into a beginning.\n--></T>
