  <T n="entry_text_description">0x8604F43F<!--\n<font color='#0949AB'>This magical dust has unique powers and can be obtained directly from a Fairy or through Foraging. Fairies can brush it off themselves, adding it into their inventory. They also drop Fairy Dust when cleaning themselves or WooHooing/Messing Around with another Sim. Fairy Dust has a variety of magical purposes! Fairies use it to activate their Regenerate Emotional Force Ability. It can also be used to Enchant objects such as plants and items with the Nature Press. Additionally, Fairy Dust has the power to bring Gnomes to life! These little helpers can aid in gardening, repairs, cleaning, or bravely defending your household from Death and Evil Gnomes.</font>--></T>
