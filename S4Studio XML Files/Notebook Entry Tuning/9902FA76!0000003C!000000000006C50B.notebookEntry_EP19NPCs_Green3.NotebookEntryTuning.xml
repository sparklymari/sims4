    <T n="enabled">0x809356C1<!--I thought my goal in life was to preserve nature to the fullest extent, but I think my latest and greatest goal is to win back my one true love, Mother Nature. I may have sprouted to be a pal to the gardens, but I also sprouted because of love. My methods in the past may have had a touch of chaos, but I never meant any harm. She is the wind beneath my leaves, and should she ever forgive me, I'd be a better pal for it.--></T>
