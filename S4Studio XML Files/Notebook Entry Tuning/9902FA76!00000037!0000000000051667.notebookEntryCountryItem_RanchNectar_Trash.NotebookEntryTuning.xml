<b>Effects:</b> Helps Sims feel happy while making them a bit smelly. Animals seem to respond quite positively. Having Nectar that is at least Lightly Aged will improve the smell. A happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off.
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and adverse effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
