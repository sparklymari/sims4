    <T n="enabled">0xB3DED51A<!--A family who owned everything in the world had not finished <i>graabing</i> their share. And these Sims you should know, up in their chateau, had money to spend without care. Now, Geoffrey thought schools, but dear Nancy thought pools, should become their next big endeavor. But they both had such pride and could not decide on just whose idea was more clever.\n\nAnd so Geoffrey got sneaky, and Nancy got cheeky, their plans they both secretly smother. A password reset for the bank account’s net was surely to foil the other. But they could not expect the login to get wrecked, and now neither could get any money. So instead of rapport, they’re seemingly poor, and nobody won—which is funny.\n\nThis Fable was completed by delivering goods to the Fairy Council Liaison.--></T>
