  <T n="entry_text_description">0x78758779<!--\n<font color='#0949AB'>Emotion Potions can be collected in a few places. Sims can craft an Emotion Stone at the Apothecary Table once they reach Level 6 of the Apothecary Skill. The Emotion Stone allows the ability to Bottle Emotions—both one's own and others! They can also be harvested from Moody Shrubs; these plants and their seeds can be found around Innisgreen. Fairy Sims have a Bottle Emotions ability that can be purchased in the Fairy Ability Tree.\n\nEmotion Potions are needed for many high level Elixirs, but they can also be consumed outright! Each granting the Mood they contain. Drink one for yourself, or give it to a friend (or foe!) Fairy Sims can also drink these to regain some Emotional Force.</font>--></T>
