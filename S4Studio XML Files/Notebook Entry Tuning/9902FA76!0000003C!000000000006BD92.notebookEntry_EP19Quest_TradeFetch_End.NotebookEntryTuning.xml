But a woman in red did not fall for his tricks, and left the poor fella on read. So from this rejection, to his feigned affection, a plot he concocted was bred.\n\nSoon the invite was sent, at a view quite pleasant, and the front door rang with a Bell. He put on a smile, the one to beguile, his flattery spread like a spell. She sure was distracted, by how he had acted, you’d think he’d gotten the hint. But that’s all we know, for that “innocent” bro had stated she’d gone in a glint. And no one could guess that this gothy mistress would go missing, like a rare gem. Was she abducted? An act she conducted? No Lothario had dawned on them.\n\nThis Fable was completed by delivering goods for the Trader.--></T>
