    <T n="enabled">0x2AF10263<!--There once was a spirit, grown from soil and love, who spent their days tending a garden. The garden belonged to a mother of nature, who watched over creatures she’d pardon. Now, the spirit’s first error was insecure terror, and their purpose felt more like a chore. So attempting great power, like their beloved flower, they let envy spread like a spore.\n\nThe spirit pursued sprouts of imitation, but never accomplished pure life. They could not achieve the maiden’s prestige, their projects just ended in strife. Lost in the sauce, the power they sought, was one that could not be discerned. And a fellow once mellow, went full green from yellow, regarding the lover they spurned.\n\nSoon one day enraged by modernity’s claim, their Gnomes came straight to defend. They descended upon the village town’s lawn, seeking justice for their dear friend. A war did break out, and at first it was thought that greenery could be preserved. But this battle they fought, would soon be found fraught, as failure was what they deserved. And so from betrayal, the maiden did leave. The spirit now all on their own. But with their good deeds the spirit believes her heart will be theirs once they’ve grown.\n\nThis Fable was completed by helping the Garden Pal.--></T>
