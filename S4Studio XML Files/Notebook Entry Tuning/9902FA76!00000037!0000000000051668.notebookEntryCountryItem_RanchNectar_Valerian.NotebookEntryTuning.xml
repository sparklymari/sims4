<b>Effects:</b> Helps Sims feel happy, with a little something extra for Spellcasters. If Nectar is at least Lightly Aged, Spellcaster effects increase significantly. A happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off.
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and adverse effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
