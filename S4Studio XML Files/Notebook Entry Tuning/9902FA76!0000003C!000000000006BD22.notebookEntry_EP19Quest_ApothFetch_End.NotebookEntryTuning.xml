    <T n="enabled">0xEE5F675B<!--Upon a full moon, at a werewolf’s high noon, emotions were stirring down under. A boy had just met a creature to pet, but a greeting with Greg he did blunder. He went screaming away, telling neighbors <i>that stray</i> had pierced the boy’s skin with its teeth. But no marks were seen, the boy’s skin was clean, and the story was swept underneath. Again and again, that sweet charlatan would spin tale after tale about Greg. Now just wait and see, for his ultimate plea, was that Greg had consumed his whole leg.\n\nOf course you can see that below the boy’s knee, was his leg which was perfectly fine. And the neighbors of Mill were no longer so chill with the boy’s constant need to malign. Then there’s Greg who’s fed up, with this pestering pup, who had bothered him all day and night. So when the boy came, there was no more shame, Greg decided to go for a bite. The boy sure did yelp, and he sprinted for help, but nobody came to the scene. I guess you could say, the boy got his way, 'cause now he had proof Greg was mean.\n\nThis Fable was completed by helping the Apothecary Vendor.--></T>
