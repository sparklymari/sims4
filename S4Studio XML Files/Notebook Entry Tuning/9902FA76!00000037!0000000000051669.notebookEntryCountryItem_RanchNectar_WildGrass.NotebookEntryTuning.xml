<b>Effects:</b> Helps Sims feel happy and reduces tension. Surprisingly filling! If Nectar is at least Lightly Aged, tension and Hunger reduction is stronger. A happy feeling persists after Nectar wears off.
<b>Aging:</b> Leave Nectar bottles unopened to let them age. Once a bottle reaches "Lightly Aged," positive effects are enhanced and adverse effects are reduced. Nectar bottles gain maximum Simoleon value when they reach "Finely Aged." Nectar will age moderately faster if stored in a basement or cellar, or significantly faster if stored in a Nectar Rack.</font>--></T>
