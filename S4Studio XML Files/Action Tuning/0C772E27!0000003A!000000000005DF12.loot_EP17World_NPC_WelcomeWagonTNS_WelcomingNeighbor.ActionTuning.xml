                  <T>0xD4BEA978<!--If you're interested in Tarot, I've heard there's some secret group around. What was it? Oh yeah! the "Order of Lenore." I hear the Tarot Tome Shrines in each neighborhood of Ravenwood are a great place to get started. If you're having trouble finding them, the <b>Town Hall</b> has some more information too.  --></T>
                  <T>0x1424361A<!--If a bunch of strangers showing up at your door with food isn't festive enough for you, you can always search out the many festivals that Ravenwood has to offer! Whether you're interested in having your Tarot cards read at the Thinned Festiveil in Mourningvale, or simply basking in the moonlight at the Moon Revelry in Whispering Glen, you'll be entertained more than you'd ever expected and/or imagined. Be sure to check out Ravenwood Family Day in Crow's Crossing too.\n\nI think there are a few more that happen on a regular basis, but I can't remember the rest of my lines! Waylon is really particular about how this Welcoming Committee goes. Check out the <b>Town Hall</b> for more information.--></T>
