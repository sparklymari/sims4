Layne gave her this weird grimace and just said, "Why would you spend your time on <i>that</i>?". Way out of character for him. He's usually supportive of uh, other creative people I guess, but he seemed so put off by my mom even mentioning a Book of Life.--></T>

Imagine getting super, super into something only to find out that the Sim who does it best is literally related to you! Right, so, once I got into Tarot and found out that collecting a whole deck summons this Lady Ravendancer Goth, I was all in. Then I find out about some Sim named Lolita Goth, and I guess we're related somehow on mom's side of the family and all that. Can't even wrap my mind around it, right? I've heard so much totally weird gossip about our families from summoning her and talking to her.--></T>
