Once you've learned these desires, don't forget to DO what they expect! Relationships are all about give and take!--></T>

For instance, you might feel <B>Very Unsatisfied</B> in the relationship while your partner feels as happy as a clam. Try to <B>Ask about Romantic Satisfaction</B> in the <I>Learn More...
