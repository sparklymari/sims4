                  <T>0xDC4601C4<!--Hidden truths are all around us. With enough trust in one another, people are more likely to share what's deep within. Sure, if you snoop around you could find things, but isn't it also nice to just make conversation with the people around you?--></T>
                  <T>0x202FCF24<!--I once watched a nail biting round of marbles at the playground in Morensong. Poor kid played for keeps and lost all his marbles! I always wonder what happened to him. Losing your marbles is never a good thing.--></T>
                  <T>0xD028029<!--Don't you know? Tomarang is <i>known</i> for its relationship with Tigers. Our history dates back to our early ancestors, when sims would live side by side with these majestic creatures. It's our responsibility to preserve their existence you know, just like it was back then. I always frown upon those who try to sneak in at night. Imagine waking a tiger from their beauty sleep! A good way to get eaten if you ask me.--></T>
                  <T>0xD20E630E<!--If you know the tale of Khun Mae, you'll know why tassels are so special to this area. I always feel such a deep connection when I happen upon one, it's like her spirit is gifting it to me directly. Be sure to look around or simply relax on the beach, you never know when Khun Mae may leave you something special.--></T>
                  <T>0xD3310D2D<!--Of all the places in Tomarang, Beard Beard Cove is my favorite! I've heard rumors that pirates once camped out there after a storm left them waterlogged. I've yet to find proof, but keep your eyes peeled. I know there's <i>something</i> out there.--></T>
                  <T>0xF744DEB1<!--I'm quite fond of the Screaming Gecko. It's a lovely place to make new friends and share delicious food. And the hot tub! Talk about making some steamy encounters over late night drinks, <i>amiright</i>? You should check it out! It's like our not-so-secret-secret spot for Tomarang hangs.--></T>
                  <T>0xB351A3D4<!--Do you ever hear screams in the dead of night? A high shrill sound, piercing the silence, jolting you awake?! The eerie air thick with fear and humidity, as the breathy shriek pauses before announcing itself once more. You look around. You check your doors and windows. Nothing. A bead of sweat rolls down your back. Again it haunts you! Is it aliens descending from above? A being lurking in the shadows? A neighbor in need of help? No. It stings your ears once more. It's down right chilling. You pass by an open window - wasn't this shut before? Maybe, maybe not. You carefully approach, heart pounding, ears ringing. As you look at the windowsill, hesitantly waiting for a ghoul to appear, you see...a gecko.--></T>
                  <T>0xC004B7E1<!--During a perilous time, Khun Mae, before she became the Great Mother of Tomarang, accepted a quest to save the village. An elder set her on a path to seek the great Watcher, a mystical being rumored to dwell in a land not far from here.--></T>
                  <T>0xCFD1BF64<!--Legend says Khun Mae was temporarily enchanted by the Watcher to transform into a Tiger. She was gifted with ferocious strength and fearsome agility. Could you imagine becoming a tiger? You'd never encounter it today, but it's still pretty wild to think about.--></T>
                  <T>0xD10CA69B<!--Long ago when Beasts descended upon Tomarang, even after being transformed into a tiger, Khun Mae was not strong enough to face them herself. The Beasts destroyed a third of the land before she even returned with help. With the amount of damage, they never rebuilt and simply allowed nature to return and heal the grounds. I for one enjoy the extra foliage, it's peaceful to be surrounded by so much nature.--></T>
