I'll admit it, though, the whole reason I bought into it was because it meant I had a chance to look at those amazing scry bowls. Like, are those an amazing aesthetic or what?--></T>
                  <T>0xC50FD7A9<!--The Ancestor is probably the most beautiful part of Whispering Glen in my opinion. Scholars and scientists here claim it was an effigy of a long dead ruler, though considering how long I've been dead, even I don't know who carved it. Some local "paranormal experts" say the tears that the visage cries during the full moon can link back to the Netherworld, some just say it's flood water run off. Did you know it's the place people perform old rituals during the full moon? Ah, <i>rituals</i>. Just thinking about them warms my heart.--></T>

Now, of course, I'm literally a ghost so I suppose it seems as if I know all there is to know. I still really wanted to dabble in Ghost History, to feel like I'm truly the most knowledgeable ghostie I can be. Mainly because I can't stand the thought of Waylon lording that over me. Waylon!

Modern mortals don't know much about her other than that she is a renowned spellcaster and tarot card reader. She once had a legion of followers named <i>The Order of Lenore</i> that has since dwindled over the years. She has ties to the Gomes family, did you know? Some of her followers still exist, I love watching them search for her tarot deck.--></T>

We're close, but I know full well that he's a little excessive. Did you know he writes the script for the "Ravenwood Welcoming Committee" and anyone on it has to read it?

She lost one of her children in an especially tragic way, but she's missing all of her children. But the way the stories spin it is all wrong! They talk about her like she's terrifying and unapproachable. I'm sure that if you just helped her by talking to her and seeing if there's anything that would help her be more at peace, they'd find a version of Alice that's rather changed from the "scary" ghost story Sims tell. --></T>

I'm not sure if you realize this, but she was a ghost too for a long, long time before she decided to take ambrosia. It almost felt like a betrayal, given how long we were together. To make things worse, she wants me to take ambrosia now, too. Why? What's wrong with my life the way it is now?--></T>
