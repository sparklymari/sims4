I have to laugh, they built up a little play area around him too with a pirate ship. I don't know what he would have thought about pirates, but I know his own boat was rather less fearsome-looking and a bit more on the run down side at first!--></T>

I like to share family legacies, but I also want my family to develop their own personalities. I know his grandmother would love Aurelio's independent streak, too.--></T>
                  <T>0xEFDE6F67<!--I like to put a lot of energy into community work. I suppose I could put my time into other hobbies more often, but it matters to me to make this place a good place to raise a family. My great-great grandpa saw a lot of potential here when he first moved out to start a fishing trade, and I intend to keep that legacy going.--></T>

These days, my cooking's mainly pizza-focused. No, it's not my grandson demanding it- it's Ian who is all about that Canadian bacon pizza. --></T>
                  <T>0x32F2483A<!--I've been trying to stop by that Recreation Center a lot more lately since they spruced it up. There's a little game area now, and sometimes I go in to play some Simbles with folks. I'm actually not very good at Simbles, though I can play a mean game of chess.--></T>
                  <T>0xA77F55F2<!--As you know, the park is called Gilbert Gardens. The reason for that is pretty obvious if you've seen the old house within the park; way back when, that chunk of land was owned by a guy named Gilbert Gilberts. I kid you not! When he passed, he set up a trust to give the land to the city. I guess that's one way to apologize for cutting down half the sequoias in the area, eh?--></T>
                  <T>0x1903E018<!--Anchorpoint Wharf is pretty different even from the way I remember it as a kid. It was all factories for a while, then it was a bit run-down and off-putting. They've put a lot of money into revitalizing it. That's for the best, I guess, but sometimes it feels a little too polished. I can't complain too much, though; after all, they put in that anchor sculpture to commemorate my family's contributions!--></T>
