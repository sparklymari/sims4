I told Zhafira not to worry about helping with bills, but she seems to really enjoy babysitting. I'm concerned it's because she can snoop around people's houses while the kids are napping but I'm too afraid to ask. Plus, I like when she buys me lunch from time to time.--></T>

Ours is polynymic with a patronymic, which is really just a fancy way of saying we're named "Cahya's daughter".--></T>
