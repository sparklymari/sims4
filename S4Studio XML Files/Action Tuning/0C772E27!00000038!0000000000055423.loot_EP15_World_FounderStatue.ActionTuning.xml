The Tomarani people still honor her and the oath to the tigers of mutual protection.\n\nLegend says her soul continues to pass through the generations of tigers that come after her. If you keep an eye out, you might catch her watching from the brush, ensuring her promise is kept. Others say the glowing eyes are an omen of the Beasts' inevitable return. Regardless, Khun Mae lives on, in truth and in legend, as the Great Mother of Tomarang.--></T>
