But anyway, I'm sure some places have more personality than most. My house has a serious issue with flickering lights, doors slammed by someone other than Nyon, and a TV that changes to static. It's odd, almost as if I'm haunted. Though why on earth should I be? My former husbands, all absolute dears, are resting quite peacefully!--></T>

I've chosen to stay away from that well not too far from us too; I've heard what sounded like a child shrieking or having some sort of tantrum last time I came close and I just thought, "You know what?
