It's certainly interesting to be so sure that something doesn't exist when it's not only right in front of you, but it's literally who you are as well.

I admit that my approach has always been to just kind of act like things aren't so different after all. With a son in the equation, I guess my calculus was to just make it seem like it was a change but nothing dramatic. --></T>

Takama had a big part in it and we were able to put our own special touch for things that represented Kai the best. We even got to choose which urn or gravestone to use!--></T>
