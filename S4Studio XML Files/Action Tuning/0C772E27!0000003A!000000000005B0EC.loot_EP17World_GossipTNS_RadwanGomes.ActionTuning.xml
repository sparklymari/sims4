                  <T>0x96E5A780<!--Oh! You've heard the story about Moppy, that goat statue in Crow's Crossing, right? It's this whole local legend thing. Apparently some medieval nomads were off in search of sustenance when they ran into an odd woman who claimed she could read Tarot cards. Ravendancer, I think. The wandering souls were so enthralled by her that they felt as if they'd been enchanted. When they came across a goat, they thought it must be magical in some way and chased it instead of catching it to eat it. The goat led them to a bountiful land—this one! Over the years, the legend of Moppy—the goat who led them to good fortune—has been told over and over again.--></T>

I just wish she was a little bit less of a klutz. I feel like Grim's always just around the corner from our place.--></T>

Sometimes we want to be with those who reflect our beliefs back, but sometimes we also thrive in our differences while embracing our similarities. Tziporah's beliefs are somewhat different than my own, but we share so many other common values. I feel like she's a Sim I've known past my own life, if you understand what I mean.--></T>

That's why I always remind people that it's better to head over to the Town Hall sooner rather than later to meet up with an attorney to get your Will all sorted. It's easier than you think. --></T>
