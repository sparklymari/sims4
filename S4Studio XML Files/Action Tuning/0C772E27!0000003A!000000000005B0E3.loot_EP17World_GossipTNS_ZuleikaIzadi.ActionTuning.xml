That's how I ended up being so drawn to the Reaper career. The way Sims were talking about it, it was like some once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be a part of something bigger than yourself. I wish I'd heard about it while I was still alive. But now Esther and I are both into reaping together. You should see the amazing outfits that go with it.--></T>

I swear, the guy said something weird like "I can't wait" under his breath when I was telling him about Kai Aether's powers. I mean, we all die someday so I get it, but that was a little funky. --></T>

I wish I wasn't so busy; sometimes it's hard to find time to talk to her, even when I am over in the area. I've heard that a few Sims have asked her how they could help her feel more at ease. I just sort of assume she'll be anchored to that creepy old tree forever, always sad no matter what you do. I like to think I might be wrong, though. You should tell me if I am!--></T>
