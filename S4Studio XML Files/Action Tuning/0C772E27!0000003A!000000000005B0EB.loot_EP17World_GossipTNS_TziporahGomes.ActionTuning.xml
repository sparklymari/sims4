It's in Whispering Glen, right near that rock they call the Ancestor. Well, apparently some Sims think it's best enjoyed au naturale on the Full Moon. Can you imagine? Personally, I'm only there to stargaze. I'd never dream of moonbathing without clothing!--></T>

At least my grandfather had the good sense to start deciding which items should be considered Heirlooms for the family so they could be divvied up properly. My father? Not so much, and when my sister and I passed away it was a mess. Now that I have my second chance at life and all of that, I'm leaving a better example for Zelmira. I want them to feel a connection to all the things that matter to me enough to consider a part of our family story.--></T>

Xie thinks being dead is fine, and that the abilities xie has make it even better, but I can't accept it. Because I can write, I decided that I would work towards being able to write a Book of Life. When I have one, I'll be able to convince xer to come back. I know it. Esther will understand someday.--></T>
