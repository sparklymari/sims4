I have tons of stretch marks from when I had Karmine. Some folks with those are proud of them or call them tiger stripes and things like that. I think that's cool, but for me, I just work towards being neutral about some parts of my body. I don't have to love everything, but I don't have to be embarrassed about it either.--></T>
