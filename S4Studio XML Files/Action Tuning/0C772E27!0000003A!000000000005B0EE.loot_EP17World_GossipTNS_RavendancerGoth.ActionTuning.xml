                  <T>0x5944D44B<!--Would you believe there are people around that still associate me with the founding of this lovely little area? Picture it: Ages ago, right here in Ravenwood, well before anything was here of course, I'm just traipsing along minding my own business when <i>suddenly</i> I turn around, and these filthy, hungry Sims were following me! I, of course, took pity and gave them a Tarot Reading. Eventually they got distracted by some stray goat and left me alone.--></T>
                  <T>0xE9AA20E4<!--Zelmira Gomes was able to summon me once they'd collected all of my special Tarot cards. What an interesting individual; of course, our family tree has intertwined roots going all the way back to Lolita Goth, so it makes sense that there some commonalities between us. --></T>
                  <T>0xF8D6222E<!--The interesting thing about being a ghost is that a lot of time can pass in a blink. Back when this area was named after Ravens, it made sense; my family was on the ascendance and there were ravens, not crows. Now, time has passed and I see that the crows from Grim's aviary have taken over. Perhaps a century from now, it will be back in the hands (or talons) of ravens!--></T>
                  <T>0xB8912205<!--Once a week—on Wednesdays, I believe—the living and the dead gather together to celebrate the link between their worlds at the Thinned Festiveil. Of course, one must bring a gift for the tree if they attend! My relative, Zelmira, has given tarot readings there before. They certainly have a flair for it!--></T>
