And I'm not just saying that because gnomes are my buddies.\n\nGnomes were my second creation, gardening pals much like myself. They used to be enchanted all the time until <i>someone</i> put an end to it. Not to name names or anything, but it rhymes with <i>Smother Snature</i>. Anyways, now you need to enchant gnomes with Fairy Dust if you want them to help out.\n\nSome of them might call a bit...Evil, but they're mostly really helpful!--></T>
