If you ask me, that's the least he could do after building up all those factories only to let the fishing industry collapse when he felt like his investments were better spent elsewhere. Probably not something to be talking about with a new friend, though, huh. Maybe this is why people think I'm so weird.--></T>

I don't know how she does it, but she almost never comes home empty handed. Sometimes I'm lucky just to catch a single minnow at the lake in Gilbert Gardens.--></T>
