                  <T>0xB9BBC0BB<!--We bring dire news to you from Brindleton Bay. Mayor Whiskers and his army of clawed minions continue to menace the winged inhabitants of Whiskerman's Wharf. We must bide our time.--></T>
                  <T>0xD50A1FC9<!--Our crow comrades tell stories of a victory in their ongoing skirmishes with Mayor Whiskers. Approximately fourteen acorns gathered from Copperdale have been dropped upon the head of Whiskers at various points during the past week. His top hat has been dented. We repeat: his top hat has been dented.--></T>
                  <T>0xC69AB144<!--The mallards of San Sequoia are abuzz: Whiteclaw, the famous albino alligator, has announced a permanent truce between all manner of fowl and himself. This likely bodes ill for the perch population. But this is not our concern, is it?--></T>

Unfortunately, while we were able to provide immediate assistance in the matter the scene was spotted by one Dirk Dreamer who has shared an image of it to Simstagram. The image has gone viral.--></T>
                  <T>0x23E15FED<!--Word has spread through the Collective about a highly dangerous "Doodlepip" on the loose. Some argue this "Doodlepip" never existed to begin with, while others argue that line of thinking is exactly what "Doodlepip" would want you to believe. One thing is certain: we have our top birds on the case. Top. Birds. --></T>
