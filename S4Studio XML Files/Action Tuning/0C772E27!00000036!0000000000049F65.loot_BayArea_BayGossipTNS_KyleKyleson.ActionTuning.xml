Last week I set my LlamaBerry PowerSip on a bench while I was doing pushups at the park and a squirrel came by and like...knocked it over. Full can. Total waste. I'm clawing my way back to normalcy man, but it's a long road.--></T>
                  <T>0x8DB1937E<!--Word of advice: don't do your dishes in that splash pad thing at the park. Went out there for a sort of Simstagram hashtag simple living moment, ended up with a bunch of dogs fighting with me for scraps while some scandalized moms glared at me. Extremely bad vibes.--></T>

You talk once in a movie—that, by the way, I was all by myself at cuz I guess it was the last-ever showing of The Llama Hums at Midnight and I was talkin' through a scary part and next thing I know the usher's telling me I'm banned? --></T>

I was about 6 PowerSips deep and all of a sudden they start gettin' rowdy, screamin' and taking off their shirts. Was totally awesome. Me and my boy Josh used to go hard way back, but that was nuts. Maybe its something in the water over there.--></T>
                  <T>0x6FFA2544<!--People get so pressed about me doing pushups sometimes. They say things like "Why are you doing pushups right now" or "I'm calling the cops." Like just chill, doing pushups is like blinking for me, and we all gotta blink from time to time. Except for my boy Josh, yo he like never blinked. Was kinda creepy but also super rad. --></T>
