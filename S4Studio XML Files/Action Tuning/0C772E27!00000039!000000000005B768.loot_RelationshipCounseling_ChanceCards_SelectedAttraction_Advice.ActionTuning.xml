                  <T>0xE90AB5B6<!--Get to know what <B>Turn-Ons</B> or <B>Turns-Offs</B> you have towards each other and work towards improving yourselves. I can't wave a magic wand and instantly make each of you attractive...but not everything is set in stone! Become more skilled in activities that attract your partner or even just change your wardrobe to make the difference.--></T>
                  <T>0xA54483A7<!--The first step is <I>Knowing</I> if your partner is attracted to you. You can start by <B>Asking About Attraction Level</B> in the <I>Learn More... Category under Relationship</I> or by <B>Explaining Attraction Level</B> to disseminate your feelings towards them. You might find your attraction towards each other is mismatched, but that's okay! That's why we are here today!--></T>

Just use the <B>Change Sim</B> action on the <B>Dresser</B> and you can be as loosey-goosey as you want with your particular desires.--></T>
                  <T>0x5B925DA8<!--I can imagine you may find all the possibilities of <B>Turn-Ons</B> and <B>Turn-Offs</B> quite confusing. It may be difficult to tease out just what an attractive quality means. If you are confused, try to study more about each <B>Turn-On</B> or <B>Turn-Off</B> within the <I>Change Sim</I> menu on the <B>Dresser</B>.--></T>
