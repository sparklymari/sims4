                  <T>0xED44FAEB<!--Living this close to the park definitely has its advantages. Aurelio used to go to lock-in slumber parties at the Rec Center all the time, and I loved being able to take him for walks around the park when he was just a toddler. I wonder if I can get away with bringing the new baby out to fish at the lake with me?--></T>
