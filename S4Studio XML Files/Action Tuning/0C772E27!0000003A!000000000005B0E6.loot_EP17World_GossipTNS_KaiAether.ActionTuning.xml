Unfortunately, I also pushed too hard when trying to understand what happens if you provoke them. It was a terrible mistake, and I regret it in more ways than one. --></T>

You seem mostly harmless, but I like to make sure I know all the ins and outs of a situation or a person before I get too involved. Plus, around here you get a lot of ghost nonsense pushed on you if you talk to the wrong people. I don't believe in ghosts, really, and don't want them around even if they do exist. You saw my sign, right?--></T>
