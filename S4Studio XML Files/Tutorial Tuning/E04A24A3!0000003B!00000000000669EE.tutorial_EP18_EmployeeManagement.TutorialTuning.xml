Get a second pair of hands!\n\nYou can <b><font color='#199C2C'>hire an employee</font></b> by either choosing the Hire interaction from the Small Business category on the Sim you want to hire, or select the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Manage Employees</font></b> button in the Small Business panel and choose the desired Sim. Consider which skills your employees have! Depending on the tasks, their skills might make the difference between doing something good or <i>great</i>. \n\nSet the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Employee Tasks</font></b> through the Manage Employee Tasks button in the Small Business panel, so you don't have to tell them what to do every day!--></T>

If their relationship gets too low they will consider <b><font color='#199C2C'>quitting</font></b>, so make sure to praise them once in a while!\n\nYou can also setup <b><font color='#199C2C'>Employee Uniforms</font></b> in the Small Business panel. These are the clothes the employees will show up in when the shift starts.--></T>
