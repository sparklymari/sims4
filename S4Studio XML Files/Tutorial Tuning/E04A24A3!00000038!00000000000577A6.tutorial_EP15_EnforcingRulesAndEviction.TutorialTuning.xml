      <T n="text">0xA2EED889<!--Whether you're a <b>Tenant</b> or a <b>Property Owner</b>, <b>Rental Unit Rules</b>, Fines, and <b>Evictions</b> are something to take note of! When playing as a <b>Tenant</b> you can be Fined or <b>Evicted</b> if you don't follow the rules or pay rent, and playing as a <b>Property Owner</b> you can Fine a <b>Tenant</b> when they break a Rule or <b>Evict</b> a <b>Tenant</b> at any time! Read on to learn more.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x46A6F470<!--<b>Property Owners</b> can collect fines for any active broken rules shown in the Tenant Agreement. When you are notified of a rule break for any of the units you own, you can visit the unit to Prosecute Fine or you can use the mailbox or door to Deliver Fine remotely! If you are a <b>Tenant</b> Sim, when a rule violation takes place you will be immediately notified. Make sure to invite the <b>Property Owner</b> inside when they arrive at your unit angry! Promptly selecting the <b>Property Owner</b> Sim to Pay Fine will help avoid further consequences. If you believe that certain Unit Rules are unfair, you can also attempt to Negotiate or Discuss a Rule Change with the <b>Property Owner</b>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF0BC834A<!--What if you're a <b>Property Owner</b> and you don't want a <b>Tenant</b> in your Rental Unit anymore? You can always <b>Evict</b> them! There are <b>Just and Unjust Evictions</b>.\n\nThe distinction between a <b>Just and Unjust Eviction</b> is important. Just <b>Evictions</b> carry no repercussions, while Unjust ones will harm the <b>Property Owner's</b> relationship with the <b>Tenant</b>, lower the Unit Rating, and potentially lead to an <b>Eviction</b> settlement, costing additional Simoleons for the <b>Property Owner</b>. An <b>Eviction</b> is considered Just when a <b>Tenant</b> has broken their Unit Rules, failed to pay rent, or their Lease Term is up.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x977BEA83<!--So how do you Evict a Sim? In Live Mode, you can travel to your Rental Unit or invite your <b>Tenant</b> to your lot. After introducing your <b>Property Owner</b> to the <b>Tenant</b>, there should be a new Social Pie Menu Category called Rental. Within that menu is the interaction for <b>Unjustly Evict</b> or <b>Justly Evict</b>. Select the interaction and choose to <b>Evict</b> them in the following promptâ€”assuming you still want to.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x8DD412EB<!--As a <b>Property Owner</b>, you don't have to actually interact with your <b>Tenant</b> to <b>Evict</b> them. If you'd like to <b>Evict</b> them through a menu, while in Live Mode go to the bottom right of the screen to the Owned Businesses Panel. View your <b>Tenant's</b> Tenant Agreement. In this menu, there is an option to <b>Evict</b> the <b>Tenant</b> Household at the bottom left of the screen. Select this button and follow through.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x5679210F<!--Playing as a <b>Tenant</b> is a little simpler than playing as a<b> Property Owner</b> when it comes to <b>Eviction</b>. A <b>Property Owner</b> will only attempt to <b>Evict</b> your Household if you break Rental Unit Rules or fail to pay rent on time. The chance of getting <b>Evicted</b> increases for each Rule that is actively broken.\n\nIf the time does come, however, that your Household is <b>Evicted</b>, you have a short period of time where you can attempt to convince your <b>Property Owner</b> to let you stay. Go to the Rental pie menu social category and choose to Plead to Stay or Intimidate to Stay. There's a chance the <b>Eviction</b> might be revoked with a fine. Depending on your <b>Property Owner's</b> <b>Personality Traits</b>, they may even be more or less likely to show leniency!--></T>
