      <T n="text">0x232FF942<!--A Will is a document that allows your Sim to pass on their assets to their current household members, or other households, depending on what's being passed down.\n\nWhen your Sim starts their Will, they'll receive one directly in their inventory. Wills can be started on a Computer with the <b>Start Will</b> interaction. Your Sim can also start their will by hiring an Inheritance Lawyer service on the Phone!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x3D781076<!--Once a Will is created, it can be updated by interacting with it directly. As for inheritance, Sims can select individual Sim recipients for their Heirloom Objects. They can also decide where Simoleons are sent, whether it's Charity or to another Household. They can also designate a new home household for their Dependents (Sims of Child age or younger, and pets).\n\nFor personal wishes, Sims can decide what they would like their remains to be housed in, and the style of their gravestone or urn. They can also indicate their wishes for funeral activities.\n\nYour Sim can also leave a personal message that will be read to recipient Sims, along with an associated emotion to really drive home the message you're choosing to send to the next generation!--></T>
