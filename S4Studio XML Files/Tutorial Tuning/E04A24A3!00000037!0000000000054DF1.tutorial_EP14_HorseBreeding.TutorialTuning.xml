Elder Mares are not able to breed.\n\nFind a Horse's sex and age by hovering over the Horse or opening the Horse's <b>Profile</b>. To do the latter, select the Horse in the world and go to <b>More Options</b>, <b>Actions</b>, and then <b>Open Profile</b>. For a Horse who is not nearby, you can access the Profile from the <b>Relationship Panel</b>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xDEA9795A<!--Horses will need to have a Friendly Relationship to Breed. Although Sims Encourage Breeding to happen between two Horses, the Horses can refuse if there is no positive relationship! The Horses can also refuse if they don't have a high enough Relationship with the Sim who is Encouraging to Breed.\n\nSims will need to be sure to Encourage Socialization between the two Horses that you have interest in Breeding. If Horses are on the same lot, they may also Socialize with each other on their own. Horses will always need to be on the same lot to Socialize with one another. --></T>

Make sure the Horses are both awake and within the age requirements with a Friendly Relationship. It's good to make sure your Horse has their Needs taken care of and they are not uncomfortable.\n\nHorses that are already Pregnant will not be able to Breed again till after the Foal is born.\n\nIf a Breeding attempt fails, the Horses may need some time to do their own thing before Breeding again.\n\nHorses will not be able to Breed if there is a Sim Riding them! Let's try to give them needed privacy and <b>Dismount</b> the Horses first. --></T>
