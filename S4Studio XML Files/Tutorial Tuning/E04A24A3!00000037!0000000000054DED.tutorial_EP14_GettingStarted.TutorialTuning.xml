      <T n="text">0x2B306A86<!--Are you an outdoorsy, animal-lovin', go-getter, fixin' to put down roots in a place that will support your dreams? Livin' the ranch life at Chestnut Ridge might just be what you've been dreaming of!\n\nFirst take a moment to breathe in the fresh country air - there's nothin' quite like it.\n\nReady to welcome a Horse (or many?) into your home? You can adopt a young Foal and raise it with love and care, or if you're ready for riding, you can welcome an adult Horse too!\n\nThe local ranching community welcomes you with open arms and are ready to help folks of all experience levels, whether you're looking to mount up and ride for the first time or you're ready to bring home the gold at our Equestrian Center competitions.\n\nMaybe you'd prefer to start off small (pun intended) with some Mini Goats and Mini Sheep - both adorable as all get-out!\n\nThe lush soil is ideal for exercising that green thumb of yours and growing the freshest, sweetest fruits and veggies. You might even try your hand at turning your yield into delicious Nectar and, who knows, you may even make a few (or a lot!) of Simoleons by selling a few bottles!--></T>
