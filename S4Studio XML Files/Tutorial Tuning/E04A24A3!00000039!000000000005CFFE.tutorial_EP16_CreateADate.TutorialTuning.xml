      <T n="text">0xA40F140C<!--If you want to Create a Date, there are a few ways to get started. You can initiate the date by selecting a Sim in the Relationship Panel, select <b>Ask On</b>, then <b>Ask to Create a Date</b>. You can also select the Sim you wish to ask out on a date where Ask to Create a Date will appear in the Romance category.\n\nBe sure to watch those <b>Traits!</b> If you ask a Sim out, they may not always say yes. An <b>Unflirty Sim</b> might decline a date when asked but higher <b>Romantic Relationship</b> should help.--></T>

Choose a <b>Romantic Repair Date</b> if your Sims have low Romantic Relationship - just not too low - sometimes Sims can have such low Romantic Relationship they won't want to go on a date at that moment.--></T>
