      <T n="text">0x4469E04E<!--Romance Dynamics define the relationship between a Sim and their romantic partner, and can be acquired through selection in Create a Sim or through gameplay when two Sims exhibit the behavior typical of that Romance Dynamic.\n\nYou'll notice that Sims will autonomously interact with their partner in a way that reflects their Romance Dynamic - for better or for worse! Romance Dynamics also cause Sims to respond a bit differently in socialization with their partner, so you'll notice some effects on your Sim's Mood.\n--></T>

      <T n="text">0x93142FF7<!--If your Sim is discontent with their Romance Dynamic, you have some options.\n\nIn the Relationship section of the Pie Menu on your Sims' partner, your Sim can Ask to Work on Romance Dynamic. If this is successful, both Sims will be considered Working on Romance Dynamic, which means they will be able to develop a new Romance Dynamic more easily through interacting with each other for a period of time, and have reduced negative effects of any Romance Dynamic they may currently hold.\n\nAnother option to help modify your Romance Dynamic is the Romance Dynamics Dissolver Potion in the Rewards Store - or, you could just Break Up!--></T>
