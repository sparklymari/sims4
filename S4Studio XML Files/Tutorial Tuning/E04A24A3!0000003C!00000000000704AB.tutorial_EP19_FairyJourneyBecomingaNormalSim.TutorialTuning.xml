      <T n="text">0xEDE42CC6<!--If a Sim wishes to no longer be a Fairy, they can transform back into a Non-Fairy Sim by relinquishing their <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Essence</b></font>. Researching at the Mossveil Fairy Hub, on the Computer, on a Bookshelf, or by asking a Fairy how, is the first step. However, Fairies can choose to forgo their research and obtain a Fairy Seedling to summon Mother Nature whenever they need her. Fairies are able to acquire a Fairy Seedling by ordering it on the Computer or asking another Fairy for one. Asking Mother Nature to Remove their Fairy Essence will give the Sim a bottle to pour into Moondrop Springs, in Everdew, completing their transformation.--></T>
