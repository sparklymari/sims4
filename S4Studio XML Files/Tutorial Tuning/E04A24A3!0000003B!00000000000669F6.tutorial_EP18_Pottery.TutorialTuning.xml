Children can be introduced to pottery by molding <b><font color='#199C2C'>Clay blobs</font></b> and when becoming a teen they can start creating ceramics on a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Pottery Wheel</font></b>! When becoming better at pottery, your Sim will be able to craft new ceramics to use or decorate their home with!\n\nWhen your ceramic is created, it's time to make it shine by glazing it in a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Pottery Kiln</font></b>! There are many pretty glazes to choose from to make ceramics that really represent your Sim!--></T>
