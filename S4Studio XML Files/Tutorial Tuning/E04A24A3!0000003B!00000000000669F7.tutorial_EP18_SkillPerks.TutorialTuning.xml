When a Sim is practicing a Skill at a very high level, there is a chance that they will unlock a Skill Mastery Perk! That perk will allow the Sim to explore new potentials and uses of their Skills that benefit both themselves and those around them! <b><font color='#199C2C'>Elder</font></b> Sims are particularly likely to discover Skill Mastery Perks due to their extensive life experience.--></T>
