      <T n="text">0xD245ED2F<!--Bucket List or Unfinished Business goals are lifelong goals that will generally take a bit more time or effort to complete compared to most Aspiration goals, though they may range in difficulty!\n\nThese goals will generate gradually over time, as your Sim lives their life. The types of goals your Sim receives will often be based on their traits/experiences. If your Sim would rather go in a different direction, you can <b>Scrap Bucket List or Unfinished Business</b> on the Computer or Journal to reset their goals.--></T>
