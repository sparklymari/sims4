      <T n="text">0xCED85EBB<!--Running a Ranch all by yourself can be hard! There's gardening, repairs, and animals to be tended to, and there's never a day off from the work. Animals don't take weekends off! Sometimes a single Sim can't handle it all! Hire a Ranch Hand!\n\nA Ranch Hand will come by every day to help out with the aforementioned work. They can garden, care for Horses and Livestock, and even repair broke down items on the lot. Most importantly they have the Skills to do the work well! --></T>

      <T n="text">0x26A5AC23<!--What if you don't want your Ranch Hand to do all of that? Well, you can always <b>Assign Chores</b>. When your Ranch Hand arrives, select them. In the <b>Ranch Hand</b> Pie Menu category choose <b>Assign Chores</b>. From there, you can determine if you want them to focus on <b>Gardening</b>, <b>Repairs</b>, and/or <b>Livestock and Horse Care</b>. They start off doing all of these things, but after you adjust the assigned chores, they'll only do what you want going forward.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x431954A2<!--Some tasks will only be done if you ask the Ranch Hand to do them, and some can be requested more directly. When your Ranch Hand is on the lot, select them. In the <b>Ranch Hand</b> Pie Menu category choose <b>Ask to</b>. From there, you can ask them to <b>Make a Repair</b> or <b>Water Plants</b>, which they'll do more quickly than they might have otherwise.\n\nYou can also ask them to <b>Collect Manure</b> or <b>Harvest Plants</b>. They won't do this on their own otherwise. When you have them do these things, they'll collect the "harvest" and leave it for you in the Household Inventory in Build Mode. This will allow your Household to do what they'd like with these items.--></T>

Then choose Ranch Hand. You can only have one Ranch Hand at a time, and they will arrive every day from 7AM to 7PM. They're going to be helping out around the Ranch a lot! --></T>
