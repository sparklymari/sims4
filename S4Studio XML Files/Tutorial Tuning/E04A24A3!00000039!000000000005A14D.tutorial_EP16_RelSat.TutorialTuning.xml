      <T n="text">0x978A010D<!--<b>Romantic Satisfaction</b> reflects how fulfilled a Sim feels in a romantic relationship. Unlike the shared romantic relationship level, each Sim in the relationship has their own individual level of satisfaction.
Couples with high mutual satisfaction will find it much easier to keep a strong relationship.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x8FB68235<!--A Sim's Romantic Satisfaction goes up from having positive romantic experiences. Succeeding at romantic socials is important, but don't forget about <b>Sim's Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs!</b> Knowing the Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs of each Sim in a relationship is important: catering to Turn-Ons and avoiding Turn-Offs will build high satisfaction.
On the other hand, Sim couples who can't maintain mutual satisfaction will find it harder to keep up the relationship. Blundering into a Partner Sim's Turn-Offs will certainly drive their satisfaction down. (As will breaking Romantic Boundariesâ€”"cheating" on a Partner.)--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD5310131<!--Sims may have very different or even opposing Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Each Sim will have their own needs in a relationship, reflected in their own satisfaction level. Ignore these needs at your Sims' romantic peril!
When Sims meet and introduce each other, you get to learn some of their Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. You'll find out more as they continue to interact and get to know each other.

      <T n="text">0x558C441D<!--Sims will start thinking about Romantic Satisfaction with a Partner after they have "made it official" or built a high enough level of romantic relationship. Lovebug and Romantic Sims will start with a slightly higher level of Romantic Satisfaction, while Romantically Reserved and Noncommittal Sims will start with a slightly lower level. They will stop thinking about it with that Partner once the relationship has ended or the Sim pair's romantic relationship level has dropped to a low enough level.--></T>
