Included is their <b>Sexual Orientation</b> and options for selecting which age group of Sims they are looking to meet. You will be able to select two traits from your Sim to highlight to other Sims and take a selfie that shows off your Sim.\n\nSelfies are a great way to display some personality for your Sim, but you might need to work on your <b>Photography Skill</b> if your pictures aren't turning out good.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xDF20D047<!--The <b>Matches</b> page will be a selection of potential matches for your Sim. Here you will have a variety of Sims to <b>Like</b> who will be saved for later. In each of their profiles you will see a photo of the Sim, their age, their location if they've chosen to share it, and two of their traits.\n\nWhen you see the Sim's traits you may notice that your Sim is attracted to or repelled by this trait, but when these Sims meet in person you may find that attraction is more intricate than just a trait or two. You will also see an option to <b>Refresh</b> the Sims available in your <b>Matches</b> page. After you've done this once you will need to wait some time before you'll be able to refresh again.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF01FF282<!--After navigating to the <b>Saved</b> page you will see the Sims who you've previously liked from the <b>Matches</b> page. Here you'll be able to take a variety of actions: <b>Add to Contacts, Create a Date, or Remove Sim</b>. When planning a date your Sim will immediately go on a date, which is a great way to get to know the other Sim and kickstart their relationship.\n\nSims added to the contacts will show up in your Sim's <b>Relationships</b> panel and will allow you to take the relationship at your own pace whether that's by chatting on the phone or inviting them to hang out at a lot. <b>Removing Sims</b> can open up room for more Sims in your <b>Saved</b> page, whether that's because you've already added them to your contacts or made the decision that they weren't the right Sim for you.--></T>

From here you can go on a <b>Blind Date</b> which is great if you're looking for a little more adventure, and maybe some unusual Sims will show up. There's also an option to visit <b>Cupid's Counseling</b> with your partner if you need to work through any issues in your relationships. Then there is the option to <b>Deactivate Cupid's Corner</b> if you're not interested in this app for your Sims.\n\nHowever you use Cupid's Corner it's here to make it easy for you to meet new Sims.--></T>
