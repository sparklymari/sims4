      <T n="text">0x4AF5D4EE<!--Whether you want to foster the love of your Sims or tear their families apart, <b>Ciudad Enamorada</b> is brimming with opportunities to do both.\n\nWe all have to start somewhere. Why not try <b>Cupid's Corner</b>, a Matchmaking app that can help you find your future flame?\n\nFirst dates can be awkward, but love can blossom from the most unlikely pairings when <b>Attraction</b> is involved! Ask to <b>Create a Date</b>, pick the activities yourself, and choose one of the many romantic hot spots within the city. For example, <b>Media Naranja Park</b> in <b>Plaza Mariposa</b> is perfect for a picnic on a <b>Romantic Blanket</b> or searching for <b>Axolotls</b> by the pond!\n\nWhile on a date, consider a few of these fun (and even risqué) activities for dates to enjoy! The <b>Who's Up Party Game</b> is a great alternative to small talk for breaking the ice and can reveal enough about a Sim to change the Attraction levels. Mood not quite right? The <b>García Amor Costume Trunk</b> can provide a little spice to the sweet and set the tone for a magical night, which may involve a <b>Vibromatic Nuevo heart bed</b> to shake things up.\n\nAlready in a relationship? How is that going? High <b>Romantic Satisfaction</b> is key to a good relationship. When both Sims are satisfied in a relationship, the relationship is bound to be strong.\n\nA <b>Romance Dynamic</b> may develop depending on how a Sim interacts with a Partner! This will affect how a couple interacts with each other, for better or for worse! It's up to you to determine whether you're looking for a heartwarming Wholesome dynamic, or a drama filled Strained dynamic.\n\nSo, when exploring a new relationship, remember these key things: no matter what love story you want to tell, it will be one for ages.--></T>
