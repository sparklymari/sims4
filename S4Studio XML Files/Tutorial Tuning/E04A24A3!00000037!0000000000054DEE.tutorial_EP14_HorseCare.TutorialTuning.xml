      <T n="text">0xEAD137AE<!--Socializing with your horse is a good way to get to know them better. Socializing is a need that Horses have just like Sims do! Horses come with all sorts of personalities that make some social interactions easier with some horses than others.\n\nAn Aggressive Horse might react negatively more often to Sims and Horses Socializing with them, but don't give up! Give some Horses time and Socialize more with them by using the <b>Talk To</b> interaction or trying a <b>Horse Care</b> interaction such as <b>Brush Coat</b>. --></T>

      <T n="text">0x53237680<!--To keep your Ranch Animals fed, pick up a <b>Hay Now! Animal Feeder</b> in <b>Build Mode</b>.\n\nRefilling the Animal Feeder costs a bit of Simoleons. Alternatively, refill it with harvested <b>Prairie Grass Hay</b>, which will reduce Fatigue for Horses that eat it!\n\nThe Feeder holds enough for several meals. If your Sims don't have time, hire a Ranch Hand to take care of it (and more!).--></T>

      <T n="text">0xCE464DBB<!--Yes, Horses have to go too! You can pick up your Horses Manure and use it as Fertilizer, but be sure to pay attention to the quality of the Manure. A happy Horse will produce an Outstanding Quality Manure that's excellent for fertilizing while a Horse with low Socialization or discomfort will have a Poor Quality Manure.\n\nIf you want to reap the natural Rancher benefits of Manure, try to make sure your Horse's needs are in excellent condition. You will be able to check the Quality once you pick up the Manure by selecting <b>Put in Inventory</b> and the bag is placed in your Sim's Inventory. --></T>
