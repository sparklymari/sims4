      <T n="text">0xF4A94D6B<!--<font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Homes</b></font> provide a cute and cozy environment for a Fairy to rest their weary wings, but they're so much more than a place to sleep!\n\nFairies can use Fairy Homes to regenerate <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force</b></font> and fulfill other Needs like Energy and Hygiene. They can also throw amazing dance parties for themselves and their Fairy friends! Non-Fairy Sims can dance alongside the home to feel included in the fun!\n\nFairy Homes also accumulate <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font> with use, so Fairies and Non-Fairies alike can shake the Home to see if they can snag some of the magical dust! (See <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font> Lesson)\n\nYou can find the Fairy Home in Build Mode, under the Outdoor Activities category.--></T>
