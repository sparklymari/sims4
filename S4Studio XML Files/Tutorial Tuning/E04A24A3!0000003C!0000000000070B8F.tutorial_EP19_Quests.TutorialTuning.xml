      <T n="text">0x25A46E62<!--<font color="#199C2C"><b>Fabulists</b></font>\n\nFables can be acquired from the Innisgreen Locals called <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fabulists</b></font> shown on the Fable Board in every neighborhood. Fables will have the Sim deliver items, or engage in riddles. After completing a fable, the Fabulist rewards your Sim with Simoleons, lore for their Notebook, and other enchanted items. You can track your tasks and progress under the career panel.\n\n<font color="#199C2C"><b>Trading</b></font>\n\nFabulists, apart from Spruce Almighty, will also offer the ability to trade one item for another. Each Fabulist only trades for a specific item or set of items, which can be determined by their heavily hinted response. Only one item can be traded at a time.\n\nSome items a Fabulist could be looking for include but aren't limited to: Apothecary Ingredients, Children's Toys, or Elixirs, as well as various plants and seeds that can be found around Innisgreen.--></T>
