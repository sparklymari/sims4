      <T n="text">0x832F388E<!--Create a Sim is the easiest way to begin your journey into the world of Fairies! To start, select Fairy in the Occult picker! Fairies have two Forms: A <font color="#199C2C"><b>Non-Fairy Form</b></font> and a <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Form</b></font>. These two can be linked together, so changes made to one will be made to the other, or you can unlink them and create something entirely unique for your Fairy Form. If you prefer the look of a Wingless Fairy, select the 'X' on the current Wings to remove Wings. Winged and Wingless Fairies each have the same capabilities, so choose whichever style you like best!\n\n<font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Wings</b></font> come in various sizes and shapes and can be customized in multiple ways. Once you select a Wing style, you can change or randomize the colors. But the real magic begins when you enter <font color="#199C2C"><b>Wing Paint Mode</b></font>!--></T>

Enter Wing Paint Mode by selecting the image of the Paint Palette next to the color selection.\n\nHere, you can access various brushes and stamps to use on the Fairy Wings. You can use multiple tools like the eraser and eyedropper tool to select a color or press the paint bucket to cover the entire Wing with the currently selected colors.\n\nIf you want to reset your Wing Painting, select the Clear All button to revert back to your base Wing.--></T>
