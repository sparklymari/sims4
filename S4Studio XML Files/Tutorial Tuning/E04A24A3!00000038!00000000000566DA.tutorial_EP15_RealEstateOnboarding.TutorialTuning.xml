      <T n="text">0x5B30CF1B<!--Tomarang is comprised of two neighborhoods and the people within have a rich culture and a strong sense of community. Delicious <b>Tomarani Cuisine</b>, vibrant dances, and games help to bring the neighbors together and are just a few of the things found here. A deep appreciation for local legend, history, and the regions’ natural wonders is a must. Keep an eye out for limited edition <b>Marbles</b> or brightly colored <b>Tassels</b> as you venture forth!--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE05A002E<!--Morensong is a bustling city center. Sims come together during the day with their families to play games like <b>Hopscotch</b> or <b>Marbles</b> in shared spaces. In the evening, many treasures are waiting to be found at the <b>Night Market</b>—whether it’s community, tasty dishes, or trinkets, Sims are sure to find what they’re looking for. The area is richly adorned with statuary, walkways, and beautiful architecture. Be sure to stop by <b>Tinsu Temple</b> as well.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC4360D9B<!--Located along the seaside, in the bustling neighborhood of Morensong, the <b>Night Market</b> boasts a variety of experiences for locals and tourists alike. From 6pm to 2am, the <b>Night Market</b> illuminates the streets, offering famous <b>Tomarani Cuisine</b> that will satisfy all. Surround yourself with many enticing dishes to choose from, including vegetarian options, traditional drinks, and delicious desserts. Food is not the only thing that can be found here! Peruse clothing, unique trinkets, and hidden treasures sold by local vendors. No <b>Night Market</b> would be complete without the freshest fish, so don’t skip out on the <b>Fish Market</b> where a Sim can purchase the catch of the day!--></T>

      <T n="text">0xAD6581C2<!--Life moves a little more slowly on this side of town. Koh Sahpa is a fishing hub for Tomarang and is nestled within the water ways and dense forests. It is home to the <b>Sulea Tiger Sanctuary</b>, where Sims can donate and support the local tiger population. Visit the Sanctuary for more information about the conservation efforts here or come back in the evening for more... sneaky activities. Enjoy nature by going for a swim or exploring the cavernous depths of <b>Beard Beard Cove</b>. This is also a great place to <b>release a Sky Lantern</b> for a <b>Child of the Village</b> Sim, though that can be done anywhere outdoors.--></T>
