      <T n="text">0xA5DA725B<!--Each <b>Residential Rental</b> unit includes a Tenant Agreement set by the <b>Property Owner</b> that offers comprehensive insights into your lease. To access this agreement as a <b>Tenant</b>, simply navigate to the 'Home' category on your Phone or Computer and select <b>Show Tenant Agreement</b>.\n\nHere's what you'll find in the Tenant Agreement:\n\n1. <b>Rent Per Day</b>: This figure represents your daily rent amount. Your total rent due is calculated weekly on Pay Day.\n\n2. <b>Lease Length</b>: This denotes the duration of your lease before the Grace Period becomes active. During this Grace Period, you can move out without facing any consequences.\n\n3. <b>Unit Rules</b>: All active rules for the unit are listed here, outlining the guidelines you must adhere to. Any infractions and associated fines are also displayed in this section.\n\n4. <b>Unit Rating</b>: The unit's rating is displayed, impacting the overall quality of your residential experience.--></T>
