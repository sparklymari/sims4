      <T n="text">0xBDEA782B<!--Horses have four unique Skills of their own that affect how they interact with Sims and how well they'll perform at Community Jobs and Horse Competitions. These Skills include: <b>Temperament</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Jumping</b>, and <b>Endurance</b>.\n\nAs these Skills improve, a Horse's value will increase, allowing Sims who specialize in Horse Training to make substantial Simoleons from training and selling Horses.\n\nYou can view a Horse's Skill levels by selecting them in a Sim's Relationship Panel at the bottom right of the screen, then choosing "Open Profile."--></T>

      <T n="text">0x95DF7D78<!--Horses with high <b>Temperament</b> Skill buck less often when being ridden and get along more easily with Sims and other Horses. They also perform better at certain <b>Community Jobs</b> and the Western Pleasure, Show Jumping, and Ultimate Horse Championship <b>Competitions</b>.\n\nA Horse's <b>Temperament</b> Skill is built when a Sim cares for and socializes with that Horse. Skill can also be acquired by sending a Horse for training using the <b>Ranch Community Board</b>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x656EFFC1<!--A Horse's <b>Jumping</b> and <b>Agility</b> Skills can be trained on the <b>Horse Barrels</b> and <b>Horse Jumps</b> training objects. While riding a Horse during training, a Sim's <b>Horse Riding</b> Skill will also increase on these objects!\n\n<b>Tip:</b> When training, a Horse may become Fatigued. At that point, it's probably best to give them a break and train more later! --></T>

      <T n="text">0xF02D8219<!--A Sim must be mounted on a Horse to start training with <b>Horse Barrels</b> or <b>Horse Jumps</b>. As <b>Horse Riding</b> Skill develops, a Sim can learn to <b>Direct Horse to</b> train on their own without a rider. This is a great way for Children to train Horses, since <b>Horse Jumps</b> and <b>Horse Barrels</b> are a little too dangerous for them! --></T>

      <T n="text">0x415EF21B<!--A Sim with low <b>Horse Riding</b> Skill and a Horse with low <b>Agility</b> or <b>Jumping</b> Skill can <b>Practice Barrels</b> on <b>Horse Barrels</b> or <b>Practice Basic Jumps</b> on the <b>Horse Jumps</b>. This gives a small amount of Skill increase for Horses with a smaller amount of Fatigue.\n\nAs a Sim improves their <b>Horse Riding</b> Skill they can also choose to <b>Intensely Train</b>. This increases the amount of Skill a Horse is gaining, but also will Fatigue them much faster. Horses who have higher <b>Jumping</b> or <b>Agility</b> score also have a more "advanced" option for training on these objects. They can <b>Race Barrels</b> or <b>Practice Advanced Jumps</b>, which does the same thing as <b>Intensely Train</b>.\n\nThese options for improved training technique are great when an experienced Horse rider is trying to train an unskilled Horse or a more skilled Horse is being trained by a Sim who is new to <b>Horse Riding</b>. --></T>
