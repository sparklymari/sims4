      <T n="text">0x57F0EBA3<!--Death does not play favorites, and Fairies can die just like any other Sim, but there are two new, unique ways for Fairies to meet their end: <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Starvation</b></font> and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Overloading</b></font>.\n\nWhen a Fairy begins losing <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force</b></font>, whether by performing Abilities or depleting over time, they will become <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotionally Starving</b></font>. If the Fairy doesn't regain some Emotional Force soon, they will become <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotionally Ravenous</b></font>.\n\nOnce Emotionally Ravenous, Fairies must obtain more Emotional Force as soon as possible, or the consequences will be fatal, and they will die of Emotional Starvation!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x6543FA33<!--Overloading happens when a Fairy absorbs too many strong emotions. The process starts with the Fairy receiving an <font color="#199C2C"><b>Impending Overload</b></font> Moodlet to warn the Fairy they need to be careful, or they will become Overloaded!\n\nOverloading has three different levels: <font color="#199C2C"><b>Minor, Major</b></font>, and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Critical</b></font>. Once the Fairy reaches Critical, it's time to stop absorbing, or else the worst can happen...the Fairy will Die!\n\nThere are three different types of Overloading, depending on what Emotions a Fairy has been Absorbing:\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Hysterical</b></font>: Happy, Inspired, Confident, Energized, Flirty, Playful, and Focused\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Enraged</b></font>: Angry, Tense, and Bored\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Mortified</b></font>: Sad, Embarrassed, and Scared\n\nOnce a Fairy has begun to Overload by entering the Minor, Major, or Critical states, any more absorption of those specific Emotions will push them closer to the next Overload level. Over time, the Fairy will recover, as long as the Fairy doesn't absorb any more powerful emotions.--></T>
