      <T n="text">0x3443F07B<!--Enjoy gardening and make caring for plants easier with a sprinkle of Fairy Dust. Sims can <font color="#199C2C"><b>Enchant</b></font> any plant using <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font>, which will take care of watering, weeding, and bugs for as long as the enchantment holds. Enchanted plants also grow as if they are in-season, even when they are not. <i>(Seasons)</i>\n\n<font color="#199C2C"><b>Pixies</b></font> are attracted to Enchanted plants and may swarm them and other plants nearby. Pixies are mostly harmless, but they are territorial and will block Sims from interacting with plants. Non-Fairy Sims can try to chase the pixies away but may not always be successful. Fairy Sims, on the other hand, can gently shoo pixies, and this will make the pixies leave the plants.\n\nThere are also three new special plants to discover, known as Everdew Plants: the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Aura Blossom</b></font>, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Moody Shrub</b></font>, and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Lightning Root</b></font>. These plants have special properties that Sims can interact with. Learn more about them in the next slide!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x804BC13C<!--Everdew Plants include the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Aura Blossom</b></font>, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Moody Shrub</b></font>, and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Lightning Root</b></font>. Wild Everdew Plants can be found in none other than Everdew itself, where they originated. Sims can obtain <font color="#199C2C"><b>Aura Petals</b></font>, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotion Potions</b></font>, and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Lightning Root Leaves</b></font> from these plants, which are useful for <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothecary</b></font> as well as completing <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fables</b></font>.\n\nSims can grow their own Everdew Plants with <font color="#199C2C"><b>Everdew Plant Seeds</b></font>. Finding these rare seeds may be challenging but can be done through <font color="#199C2C"><b>Foraging</b></font>, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fables</b></font>, and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Trading</b></font>.\n\nThese seeds can be Foraged in any <font color="#199C2C"><b>Innisgreen neighborhood</b></font> by having a Sim <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage for Plants</b></font>. Foraging them requires at least Level 7 in <font color="#199C2C"><b>Natural Living Skill</b></font>. Having <font color="#199C2C"><b>Good Luck</b></font> improves your chances to find these seeds, while <font color="#199C2C"><b>Bad Luck</b></font> makes it less likely.\n\nAdditionally, Sims can take on Fables in the Everdew neighborhood by speaking with Fairies and earning Fables. The <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Liaison in Everdew, Care Ren,</b></font> may also be willing to trade <font color="#199C2C"><b>Everdew Seeds</b></font> in exchange for specific items. Everdew Seeds can also be purchased at Clover's Seed and Supplies in Sprucederry, but these rare seeds are only available in limited quantity!--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF72A01F2<!--Besides their beauty, Everdew Plants have special abilities:\n• The <font color="#199C2C"><b>Moody Shrub</b></font> pulses with emotion, and Sims may harvest bottled <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotion Potions</b></font> from it. Sims may, in return, use <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotion Potions</b></font> on the plant to change which emotion the shrub will express.\n\n• The <font color="#199C2C"><b>Lightning Root</b></font> is a vine with powerful electrical force running through it. Sims can attempt to pick the leaves for use with <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothecary</b></font>, as well as <font color="#199C2C"><b>Hook Up</b></font> the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Lightning Root</b></font> to their power grid to lower their power bills. Beware: Handling the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Lightning Root</b></font> is risky and careless Sims who don't heed the shock may get electrocuted.\n\n• The <font color="#199C2C"><b>Aura Blossom's</b></font> flowers give off powerful <font color="#199C2C"><b>Auras</b></font> that affect nearby plants and Sims. Sims may use <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font> to transform the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Aura</b></font> and get different effects. <font color="#199C2C"><b>Aura Petals</b></font> can be collected as an <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothecary Ingredient</b></font>.\n\nEverdew plants need care like any other plant. If left without water, until they are hydrated again these plants will cease to project Auras, Emotion, or Electricity and Sims won't be able to collect any ingredients from them.--></T>
