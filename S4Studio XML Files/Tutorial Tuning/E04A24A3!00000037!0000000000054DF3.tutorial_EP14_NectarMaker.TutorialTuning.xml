      <T n="text">0x27A5DD9<!--Before you can <b>Craft Nectar</b>, you're going to need Ingredients! Basic Ingredients can be purchased on the <b>Nectar Maker</b> itself or purchased at Chestnut Ridge's Bits & Bales Mercantile store in the New Appaloosa Neighborhood.\n\nThe <i>best ingredients</i>, however, are grown in gardens! Seeds can be purchased through Planter Boxes found in Build Mode or from a Computer. These purchased seeds will then be available in your Sim's inventory. Improving in <b>Gardening Skill</b>, taking care of your Plants, and planting better seeds from your Harvest will result in even better Ingredients that will make your Nectar the best it can be!--></T>
