      <T n="text">0x4AE5D8E3<!--To create your own <b>Residential Rental</b>, simply choose the lot you wish to build on, enter Build Mode, and change its Lot Type to <b>Residential Rental</b>. This can be done for both unowned lots and lots with Sims already living on them. Note that the Household occupying a Residential lot will automatically become the <b>Property Owner</b> Household upon converting to a <b>Residential Rental</b>.\n\nYour Sims can also purchase a <b>Residential Rental</b> via the Phone or the Owned Businesses panel which will automatically convert the lot purchased to a <b>Residential Rental</b>!\n\nOnce the lot is converted, you're ready to start creating and assigning units!--></T>

Each unit listed will have two tabs.\n\nThe first tab is Unit Info, where you can rename your units, check value or dimensions of the unit, update the bedroom/bathroom count, hide/unhide the unit, or delete the unit. When converting an owned Residential lot to a <b>Residential Rental</b> lot, and assigning units for the first time, you can also select which unit belongs to the current active Household by checking the Home Unit box on the appropriate unit section.\n\nThe second tab is Unit Traits and Challenges, which can be customized per unit to create unique living experiences within the same <b>Residential Rental</b>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x40B75359<!--Assigning a room to Shared via the block menu designates that room to be available for Households living in any unit. This might serve the purpose of apartment building lobbies, hallways, mail rooms, shared kitchens or bathrooms, or whatever you'd like! Rooms assigned to units not currently lived in by the active Household will be unloaded and inaccessible unless traveled to. Areas that aren't part of selectable rooms, including all outdoor area, is automatically considered Shared space.\n\nWhen creating a <b>Residential Rental</b> with many units, it's important to create accessible space leading to the entrance of each unit. Whether it's via shared hallways, or perhaps outdoors entrances, it's important for your Sims to be able to reach their unit!--></T>
