      <T n="text">0x7E5E8C9D<!--When a Fairy becomes a Teen or older, they will manifest their full <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Form</b></font> with Wings! This can be customized in Create a Sim. You can access Create a Sim by selecting Plan Outfits on any dresser or through the Simology Panel. While in Live Mode, Fairies can <font color="#199C2C"><b>Reveal</b></font> or <font color="#199C2C"><b>Conceal their Fairy Form</b></font>, which will show and hide their Wings.\n\nBy default, Fairy Sims in their Fairy Form will hover around the world instead of walking, and fly up and down ladders. This behavior can be changed at any time by selecting a Fairy while in Fairy Form and choosing <font color="#199C2C"><b>Disable Flying & Enable Flying</b></font>.\n\nFairies not in their Fairy Form will usually walk just like other Non-Fairy Sims. If they are a short distance away, they may walk instead of hover in Fairy Form as well.\n\nFairies can also <font color="#199C2C"><b>Instantly Fly</b></font> anywhere that is a valid place for Sims to navigate to!--></T>
