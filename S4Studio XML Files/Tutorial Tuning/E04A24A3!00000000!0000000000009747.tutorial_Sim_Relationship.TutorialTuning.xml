      <T n="text">0x87A1C721<!--Relationships between Sims of different ages will now face different advantages and challenges. Sims will gain or lose relationship at different speeds depending on both the types of interaction <b>and</b> the age of the other Sim.\n\nFor example, Child Sims will become friends much faster with other Child Sims, since they understand each other so well. But a Child Sim will find it a bit more difficult to raise their relationship with a Teen or Young Adult Sim, who might take the Child less seriously than their peers. Adult Sims will struggle to raise their relationship with Teen Sims, as Teens will often see them as uncool. But Adult Sims will have a much easier time befriending Elders.--></T>
