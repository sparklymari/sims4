      <T n="text">0x672C34F1<!--It is important to keep in mind how others perceive you and your Small Business! When registering a Small Business, your <b><font color='#199C2C'>Alignment</font></b> will start out as <b><font color='#199C2C'>Neutral</font></b>.\n\nWhen opening up your Small Business, you will sometimes encounter <b><font color='#199C2C'>Small Business Dilemmas</font></b>. Depending on how you resolve them, your Alignment will start to swing in a direction, either towards a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Dreamer</font></b> or <b><font color='#199C2C'>Schemer</font></b> Alignment.\n\nUsing certain <b><font color='#199C2C'>Small Business Perks</font></b> will also alter your Alignment. You can see which Alignment a perk is related to in the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Small Business Perk Panel</font></b>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE6E7113E<!--When the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Alignment</font></b> has started swaying into a direction, Sims around you will start to notice!\n\nYou will find that customers who agree with your Alignment will visit your Small Business more frequently and encourage the way you run it! At the same time, Sims who don't agree with your Alignment might be quite disappointed. Hey, who are they to judge?\n\nAlignment also affects how your Sim feels about themselves. If they agree with the Alignment they may feel pleased with their achievements, while mismatching Alignment will make them feel conflicted about their choices. Others close to your Sim may also feel proud or ashamed of your Sim, depending on whether they agree to the Alignment or not.--></T>
