      <T n="text">0x88FBEE34<!--<b>Mold</b> is a new <b>Lot Challenge</b> available with <i>For Rent</i>. This <b>Lot Challenge</b> can be placed on any <b>Residential or Residential Rental</b> lot in the Traits Panel in Build Mode. Adding this <b>Lot Challenge</b> will allow <b>Allergenic and Toxic Mold Piles</b> to spawn when a nearby plumbing object is dirty, there is a puddle on the floor, or trash is overflowing.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x67C0F08C<!--Mold Ghosts have become one with <b>Mold</b> in death. They have special abilities which allow them to Spoil Food, Blow Fertilizing Spores on plants, and Create Fungal Overgrowth to spawn mushrooms! They also enjoy talking to plants (and especially mushrooms) and hate it when their "mushroom-kin" are eaten nearby. Watch out though, they might also inadvertently spawn <b>Allergenic Mold piles</b> as they float around.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x30B82ED5<!--The best way to deal with <b>Mold</b> is by preventing it in the first place. Keep your space and plumbing objects clean! If, however, mold does appear you can deal with it in a handful of ways. Mold can always be cleaned the classic wayâ€”each pile at a time. The quickest but most expensive way is with a Mold-B-Gone Bomb. While environmentally friendly, these do cost extra money! For those who enjoy chaotic moments though, you really can't do better than choosing to purge the mold with fire. Good luck!--></T>
