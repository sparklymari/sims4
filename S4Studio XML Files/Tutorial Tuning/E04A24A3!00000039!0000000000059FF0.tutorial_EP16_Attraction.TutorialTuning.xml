      <T n="text">0xDDA5032D<!--Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs are set in Create a Sim and determine how attracted Sims are to each other. Sims can be attracted to physical attributes (like hair or outfit color) or their personality and characteristics. Sims attracted to your Sim will be easier to build romantic relationships with. Attraction can change as the Sims get to know each other based off of their Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x8DF93B86<!--To set or change a Sim’s Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, go to Create a Sim and select the Preferences tab underneath Aspirations. Select the tab with the magnet icon to see the different categories of Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs that make up Attraction. Select any category to set specific Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Each Sim may have up to 50 Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, and these can be changed at any time through Create a Sim.\n\nThe Attraction level felt toward another Sim is controlled by the Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs set inside the Physical and Personality categories:\n\nPhysical Attraction covers everything seen on a Sim’s outside: fashion choices, clothing color, and hair color. These Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs register immediately when Sims socialize with each other.\n\nPersonality Attraction relates to a Sim's Traits, hobbies, and other aspects of their lives that aren't outwardly apparent. Sims will need to ask potential partners about themselves in order to fully understand how attractive (or unattractive) one Sim is to the other! These Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs have a stronger influence on Attraction between Sims.--></T>

These Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs don’t affect Attraction levels. Instead, they control how various types of romance contribute to each Sim’s individual Romantic Satisfaction—not all Sims feel the same way about all forms of romance after all!

Sims are also more likely to accept romantic interaction from Sims they find attractive. The opposite is also true: Sims are less likely to socialize with Sims they find unattractive and less likely to accept romance from those Sims.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC22F101D<!--Unlike the Romance score that is shared between two Sims, Attraction is an individual feeling of one Sim toward another. A Sim may be attracted to someone who does not share the feeling, and Sims in a relationship may find themselves with totally different Attraction levels!\n\nCautious Sims may want to exhaust their knowledge of a potential partner before diving into a commitment!

      <T n="text">0x10470BD8<!--How does one Sim know what another Sim finds attractive? Well, by asking them! Select another Sim, choose the “Relationship” category, then choose “Ask about…Attraction” interactions to find out the various Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs of other Sims.\n\nLikewise, the way to know another Sim’s overall Attraction level is by asking. Select another Sim, choose the “Relationship” category then the “Learn More” category, and finally choose “Ask for Attraction Level.”\n\nSims may be able to make themselves more attractive by avoiding a partner’s Turn-Offs and meeting their Turn-Ons—for example, by changing hair color or cultivating new Skills—but some Sim couples may simply have to put in extra effort or call it quits if Attraction grows to be unmanageable!--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD29121D<!--Depending on their Physical Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs, a Sim may experience instant Attraction to a potential romantic interest. However, the story doesn’t end there!\n\nAs your Sim gains knowledge about another Sim, Attraction can go up or down depending on Personality Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Learning new personal information such as Traits, Skills, or even financial status can significantly change the Attraction level your Sim feels toward another.\n\nSims feel Attraction based on their most recent knowledge. If your Sim is turned off by Nature activities and meets someone with low Gardening skill, that Turn-Off won’t really do anything. However, if that other Sim later builds up to high Gardening skill and your Sim finds out, the Turn-Off will trigger and potentially lower your Sim’s Attraction level to the unlucky gardener.--></T>
