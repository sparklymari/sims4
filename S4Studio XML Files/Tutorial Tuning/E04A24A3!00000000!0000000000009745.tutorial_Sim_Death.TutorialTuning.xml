When Sims meet their untimely (or timely) demise, a Sim can begin a new chapter by becoming a Ghost.\n\nBy choosing <b>Become a Playable Ghost</b>, the Sim will remain in the Household and continue to be playable as a Ghostly presence.\nChoose <b>Become a Freeroaming Ghost</b> if you would prefer this Sim <i>live on</i> as a Ghost in an unplayed Household. These Sims will no longer be a played Sim but can still be found in the World.--></T>
