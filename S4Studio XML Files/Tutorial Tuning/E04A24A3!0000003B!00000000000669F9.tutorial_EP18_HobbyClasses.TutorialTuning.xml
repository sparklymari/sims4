      <T n="text">0xDD31D50<!--When Sims who are Teens or older reach level 5 in any Skill (or level 3 if it's a Minor Skill), they can hold a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Lecture</font></b> from a Hobby Whiteboard, which other Sims can attend to improve their own skills.\n\nThe higher the lecturer's Skill level, the faster the listeners learn. You can think of Lectures as <b><font color='#199C2C'>Mentoring</font></b>, but for multiple Sims at once!\n\nChildren can also attend Lectures if the related Skill is available to them, such as Logic, Video Gaming, or Violin.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD063084<!--<b><font color='#199C2C'>Hobby Classes</font></b> are a Social Event with Goals and Rewards that can be initiated from a Hobby Whiteboard at a Small Business. Customers pay to participate, with the fee depending on the instructor's Skill level and the number of goals achieved before the end of the class.\n\nTo start a Hobby Class on a specific Skill, the Owner or Employee running the Class must have at least level 5 in that Skill (or level 3 for a Minor Skill). Certain Skills also <b><font color='#199C2C'>require objects</font></b> to be purchased and placed near the Whiteboard, such as Easels for a Painting Class, within the <b><font color='#199C2C'>designated outline</font></b> that appears in Build Mode.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC954656B<!--Hobby Classes can also be held by <b><font color='#199C2C'>Employees</font></b> autonomously, which will not be an Event with Goals and Rewards. This can be done by assigning the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Run Classes</font></b> task to an Employee with an eligible Skill level and making sure any required objects are placed if necessary.\n\nUse the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Enable Specific Employees Led Classes</font></b> interaction on the Hobby Whiteboard to limit which Classes these Employees may run. Remember that even if a certain topic is allowed, the Employee still needs the Skill level and the required objects to run the Class.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x21AB3C9B<!--When your Sim visits a Small Business as a customer, they can attend a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Hobby Class</font></b> by choosing the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Ask to Start Class</font></b> interaction on the Hobby Whiteboard (for a small fee, of course).\n\nWhile attending a Hobby Class, your Sims will increase their Skill level at record speeds. Depending on how many Goals they complete, they get Moodlets that give a small, medium, or large boost to their Skill learning for the next few hours.\n\nThere are several ways your Sim can attend a Class with someone else! You can make sure they're in a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Group</font></b> before the Class starts, use the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Invite to Join Class</font></b> on the Sim, or have them <b><font color='#199C2C'>Join Class</font></b> on the Whiteboard.--></T>
