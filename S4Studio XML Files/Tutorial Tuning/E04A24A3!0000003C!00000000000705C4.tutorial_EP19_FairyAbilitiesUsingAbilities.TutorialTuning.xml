      <T n="text">0xC6CCD5EB<!--Fairies have magical <font color="#199C2C"><b>Abilities</b></font> that will help them in their day-to-day needs and interactions with other Sims. Will they create harmony or chaos? There are four different types of Abilities: <font color="#199C2C"><b>Manipulation, Emotion, Nature,</b></font> and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Passive</b></font> Abilities.\n\nAll Abilities consume <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force</b></font> to perform and will reward the Fairy with <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Experience</b></font> to level up and unlock new, unique Abilities! Abilities can be performed on other Sims, Plants, Objects, Animals or the Fairy themselves.\n\nAbilities range from simple things like influencing a Sim's Emotions, to the more powerful ones like turning another Sim into a Fairy!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x456E662E<!--<font color="#199C2C"><b>Passive Abilities</b></font> are used to influence how a Fairy replenishes and manages <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force</b></font>. They are not active Abilities that a Sim can perform but will happen passively while a Fairy is living their life. Each level will have two options, and only one may be selected per level.\n\nPassive Abilities include effects like allowing a Fairy to obtain Emotional Force from performing positive or negative socials, or even gaining Emotional Force while they sleep!\n\nIf you want to reset your <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Ability Tree</b></font>, you can purchase a <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Ability Refund Potion</b></font> from <font color="#199C2C"><b>Mother Nature</b></font>. She can be summoned with a Fairy Seedling from a Fairy or at a Fairy Ring after completing the Rise and Shine Fable (See <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fables</b></font> Lesson).--></T>
