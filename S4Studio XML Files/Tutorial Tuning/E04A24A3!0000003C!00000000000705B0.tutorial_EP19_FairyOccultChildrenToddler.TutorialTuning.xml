      <T n="text">0x248C27B7<!--Fairy Toddlers and Children have some unique qualities that will differentiate them from other types of Sims. They don't need <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force</b></font> yet, but their Hunger and Bladder Needs will decrease slower, as they are still growing into their full Fairy selves. They also will gain Thinking and Imagination Skills more quickly!--></T>

      <T n="text">0xFEDF8182<!--Sometimes when waking up, Toddler and Children Fairies may wake up with an <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Struggles</b></font> Moodlet, which will occasionally cause the little one to break objects around them!\n\nTeen and older Fairies have the ability to <font color="#199C2C"><b>Help Manage Emotions</b></font> on the younger Fairies, which will temporarily suppress the Angry Outbursts. With practice, this behavior can be eliminated entirely!\n\nAfter an older Fairy has helped manage emotions enough, when the Toddlers or Children wake up, they will have an <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Stability</b></font> Moodlet that will send a pulse around them that makes nearby Sims happy!--></T>
