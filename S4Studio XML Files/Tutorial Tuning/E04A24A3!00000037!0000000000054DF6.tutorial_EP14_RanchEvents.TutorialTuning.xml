      <T n="text">0x6515A2E8<!--Want to show off your Ranch? Meet your neighbors? Try planning either a <b>Ranch Animal Day</b> or a <b>Ranch Gathering</b> event!\n\nAt a <b>Ranch Animal Day</b> event, family, friends, and neighbors gather together to care for and play with Horses and Mini Animals. Talk about cuteness overload!\n\nMeanwhile, <b>Ranch Gatherings</b> are an event filled with good-natured, rowdy fun! There's Ranch Music, Cowpoke Dancing, Grilling, Nectar Making (and drinking), and all the socialization a Sim could dream up!\n\nTo get started, select the Phone and choose <b>Social</b> then <b>Plan a Social Event</b> or go to the Calendar and choose <b>Add Event</b>. This menu can also be accessed from the <b>Ranch Community Board</b>. From there select <b>Plan a Ranch Event</b>.--></T>
