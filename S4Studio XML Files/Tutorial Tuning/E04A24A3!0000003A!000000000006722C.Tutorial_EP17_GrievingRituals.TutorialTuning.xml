      <T n="text">0x992BA9DA<!--Funerals provide an opportunity to gather, grieve, celebrate, and give Sims a chance to say their final goodbyes.\nThere are multiple ways to plan a Funeral:\n\n<b>Phone</b> and <b>Computer</b>: To plan using the Phone, select the Sim’s Phone, then the Social Icon. You can then choose Plan Funeral from the list of options. While using a Computer, you can find Plan Funeral from the Household section of the Pie Menu.\n\n<b>Urn or Gravestone</b>: Select the deceased Sim’s Urn or Gravestone and choose Plan Funeral from the Pie Menu. As an added perk, planning a Funeral from the Urn or Gravestone will automatically set the <b>Deceased Sim</b> role in the Funeral Event panel.\n\n<b>Calendar</b>: Select the Calendar, which will bring up the Calendar UI. Here you can select a specific day to plan the Funeral in advance. Once you are set on the day, select Add Funeral Event from the list of events and choose the time you would like it to start.\n<i>Using the Calendar feature is the only way to plan a Funeral Event in advance, otherwise the Funeral will begin once the event selection is complete.</i>--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD88828C2<!--When in the Funeral Planning UI, you can assign Sims to specific event roles. The <b>Deceased Sim</b> is the Sim that is being honored and the <b>Host Sim</b> is the Sim that is currently selected when planning the event.\n\nYou can add <b>Guest Sims</b>, who are Sims known to the Deceased, and if you are concerned about the crowd size, feel free to add some <b>Hired Mourners</b> to the mix. An <b>Entertainer Sim</b>, once invited, will play an Instrument when it is available on the lot chosen for the event.\n\nSelect the Guest Attire <b>Color</b> or <b>Style</b> to define how Guests should dress for the event. If nothing is selected, Guests will arrive in their set Formal Outfits.\n\nSelect <b>Activities</b> for Sims to complete during this event. A serious, formal event might mean that <b>Moment of Silence</b> and <b>Lighting Candles</b> are the desired vibe, while a more laid-back celebration of life could call for <b>Dancing</b> and <b>Giving Toasts</b>.\n\nOnce everything is set, all that’s left is setting a <b>Location</b>. Funerals can be held on a <b>Home Lot, a Cemetery, or other Venue Lots</b> that feel like they are the right fit for the type of Funeral being planned.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x52D19EED<!--There are objects found in Build Mode that are designed to work well with Funerals. Place the <b>Funeral Podium</b> during the event, which when selected, houses many Funeral interactions. <b>Burial Caskets</b> and <b>Gravesites</b> can store Sim remains and allow for Funeral interactions to be performed. Place a <b>Memorial Display</b> and <b>Memorial Portrait</b> and dedicate them to the deceased. If you would like a more celebratory event, place the <b>Memorial Cannon</b> to give the Sim the most epic send off!\n\nAlthough Guest Sims will grieve freely during a Funeral, interactions like <b>Call Over Guests</b> can help bring attention to certain activities that you would like to complete. <b>Funeral Activities and Interactions</b> can be found by selecting <b>Sims</b>, the <b>Funeral Podium</b>, and the <b>Urn or Gravestone</b> while a Funeral is in session.--></T>
