      <T n="text">0x99D9071F<!--There are some very fun utility objects in <i>For Rent</i> that spice up gameplay. One of those is the <b>Water Heater</b>. So long as there is at least one working <b>Water Heater</b> on a lot, your Household's water will stay warm. If all <b>Water Heaters</b> are broken or turned off (due to missing Plumbing or Electric utility), water will be very chilly and uncomfortable. Over time, a <b>Water Heater</b> will degrade and eventually break. To ensure that never happens, you can always Perform Maintenance on it to keep it in tip-top shape!\n\n<b>Water Heaters</b> can also be Upgraded to improve their functionality. The Robustify Inner Workings upgrade will ensure your <b>Water Heater</b> needs less maintenance. While the 5EverWarm Tech upgrade will allow your <b>Water Heater</b> to function Off-the-Grid without Plumbing or Electric utility (which is normally required for this object to function).--></T>

      <T n="text">0xA8698108<!--The <b>Solar Water Heater</b> is a more hands-off option if you're looking to ensure your water stays warm. It won't ever break and doesn't require maintenance, but this object also will only function when the sun is out and bright. If you don't mind cold showers after the sun goes down, this might be a great option.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x6E60DA33<!--The <b>Electrical Fuse Box</b> is also a new utility object in <i>For Rent</i>. When this object is placed and working, electricity will be supplied to the lot or Rental Unit, and (as a nice bonus) it also ensures that the Power Utility spent on keeping electricity going will be more economical. Talk about a savings on Bills! When it isn't working, due to Power being turned off or the <b>Electrical Fuse Box</b> being broken, the lights will flicker—which is rather concerning for a Sim!\n\nJust like with the <b>Water Heater</b>, there is an option to Perform Maintenance on this object, which will help keep it in tip-top shape and ensure it doesn't break. If it does though, it can always be repaired. It can also be upgraded with the Robustify Inner Workings upgrade to ensure it breaks less often.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x3F175549<!--These objects function on <b>Residential</b> lots, but they also function on <b>Residential Rental</b> lots. If placed in a Rental Unit they will function just for that Rental Unit. If placed in a shared space, they will function for all Rental Units on that lot and the shared spaces.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x10FC0382<!--<i>For Rent</i> also comes with two different <b>Radiators</b> and a <b>Wall-Mounted Air Conditioner Unit</b>. These objects can be turned on or off and help keep a space nice and tosty or nice and cool.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD9DA2135<!--If you aren't interested in the maintenance or gameplay that comes with the <b>Water Heater</b>, <b>Solar Water Heater</b>, or <b>Electrical Fuse Box</b> then there are decoration-only versions of these objects that you can place down simply for décor. These objects are called <b>Non-Functional Water Heater</b>, <b>Non-Functional Solar Water Heater</b>, and <b>Non-Functional Electrical Fuse Box</b>.--></T>
