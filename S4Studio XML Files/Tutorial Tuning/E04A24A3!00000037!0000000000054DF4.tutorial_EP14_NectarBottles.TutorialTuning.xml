      <T n="text">0x3A4DD119<!--When Nectar is first crafted it is Not Yet Aged. If the bottle isn't opened, it'll age slowly over time becoming first Lightly Aged, then Moderately Aged, until it reaches its peak at Finely Aged. As a Nectar ages it increases in sale value.\n\nYou can hover over a Nectar Bottle to see how aged a bottle currently is in the Hovertip. --></T>

      <T n="text">0xF7913328<!--You can store, pour, or sell your Nectar. See the <b>Nectar Aging & Nectar Rack Lesson</b> to learn more about storing Nectar and we'll cover Selling later in this Lesson. For now, let's talk about serving Nectar.\n\nEach bottle of Nectar starts off corked and has four servings within it. When you choose to Pour 1, 2, 3, or 4 Servings from the bottle you'll uncork the bottle, opening it. At this point, it won't age further and it will have a limited time before it Spoils. Opening a bottle also drastically decreases the Nectar's sell value.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF2BCD72E<!--Some Sims (we're talking about you Snobs and Foodies) prefer to only drink the <i>best</i> Nectars, so what improves a Nectar's quality?\n\nCurrent Skill Level, Ingredient Quality, and the Skill Level required to craft a bottle of Nectar all impact the quality of each Nectar bottle. To increase the chance of crafting Excellent Nectar, try improving <b>Nectar Making</b> Skill, growing high quality plants for Ingredients, or making sure a Sim is in a good mood while they are crafting.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF690A98<!--But what if you don't want to drink your Nectar? What if you're in it for the Simoleons?\n\nVarious factors impact how much each bottle of Nectar can sell for. To increase the amount of Simoleons earned from each bottle consider the following:\n\n• Nectar price increases from Not Yet Aged, to Lightly Aged, to Moderately Aged, and peaks at Finely Aged.\n\n• Nectar price increases from Poor Quality to Normal Quality, and peaks at Excellent Quality. Try using high quality Ingredients to improve the quality of Nectar.\n\n• Nectars that require more <b>Nectar Making</b> Skill to craft are worth more. Improve <b>Nectar Making</b> Skill to craft more difficult Nectars.\n\n• The Mysterious Rancher will pay more money for Nectar than selling it regularly will.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x31F95CB6<!--Different Nectars can be made by a variety of different Ingredients, but did you know that these different Nectars will have different effects on a Sim when drinking them? When you craft a new Nectar check out the Notebook next to the Sim's Phone on the bottom left of the screen. New information on each Nectar type is added here—or you can always wait to see what happens.\n\nJust be sure not to drink too much Nectar! Or do. There are consequences.  --></T>

Or if you chose to make Fruit or Berry Nectar you could specify what type of Fruit or Berry you used on the bottle itself. You might end up with "Banana Nectar"!\n\nSimply select a bottle of Nectar and choose the <b>Name</b> interaction.--></T>
