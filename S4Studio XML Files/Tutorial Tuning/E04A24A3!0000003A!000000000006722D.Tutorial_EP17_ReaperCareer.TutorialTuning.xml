Another day might require multiple reaps of Sims who have experienced a catastrophic event!\n\nOne constant, however, is the <b>Weekly Souls Quota</b>. Be sure to keep up on collecting and releasing Souls. You can learn about the Soul Quota by selecting a Computer at the office and choosing <b>Check Soul Quota</b>. If the Soul Quota is achieved over the week, the Sim will be rewarded with a gift from Grim's Box-O-Fun(eral)!--></T>
