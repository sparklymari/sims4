      <T n="text">0x83BFA542<!--<font color="#199C2C"><b>Tabletop Plant Pots</b></font> offer new ways to adorn any space with plants, indoors and out. Place these pots on countertops, tables, desks, shelves, or on the floor. Tabletop Plant Pots can be purchased in Build Mode or at Clover's Seed and Supplies store in Sprucederry. If a Tabletop Plant Pot is placed too high up, an orange outline will appear to indicate that Sims won't be able to reach it for planting, watering or other maintenance. Seeds planted in Tabletop Plant Pots need all the same care as plants in soil, so make sure your Sims take care of them.\n\nTabletop Plant Pots made of ceramic materials can also be crafted using the Pottery Wheel. <i>(Businesses & Hobbies)</i>\nThese include the TerraSphere and Concentric Pots.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xE656C3A7<!--Sims can purchase <font color="#199C2C"><b>Live Houseplants</b></font> to place in <font color="#199C2C"><b>Tabletop Plant Pots</b></font>, Garden Patches, and Planter Boxes. In Live Mode, select the plant container and choose <font color="#199C2C"><b>Purchase a Live Houseplant...</b></font>, or place them directly in Build Mode by searching "Live Houseplants" or finding them under the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Indoor Plants</b></font> category.\n\nLive Houseplants are less work than Gardening plants, but they don't grow or produce any harvestables. They do still require some care and will die if neglected. Live Houseplants can be <font color="#199C2C"><b>Enchanted</b></font> to maintain health but are immune to <font color="#199C2C"><b>Pixies</b></font>. Sims can also <font color="#199C2C"><b>Name Houseplants</b></font> and find caring for them to be enjoyableâ€”it's like having a pet plant!--></T>
