      <T n="text">0xDEEE44B6<!--Baby Fairies will arrive in their own special Fairy bassinet, welcoming them into the magical world they're born into! Fairy babies have qualities that make them unique from other babies.\n\nTheir Hunger and Bladder Needs will deplete more slowly than other babies. If a Sim has an <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotion Potion</b></font> in their inventory, they will be able to bottle feed it to Fairy infants! Even though they have not fully grown and gained their Fairy magic, Fairy Infants still love being bottle-fed Emotions and will be very Happy as a result!--></T>
