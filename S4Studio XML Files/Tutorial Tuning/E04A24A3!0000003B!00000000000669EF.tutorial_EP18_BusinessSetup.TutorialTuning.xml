      <T n="text">0xFB68D4A1<!--So, who would enjoy these activities? Set <b><font color='#199C2C'>Target Customer Criteria</font></b> to specify the types of customers you want to attract! Maybe by a specific <b><font color='#199C2C'>Career</font></b> group or someone with particular <b><font color='#199C2C'>Traits</font></b>? You can also define whether the criteria is <b><font color='#199C2C'>Required</font></b> or simply a preferred characteristic for your customer group.\n\nIf you want to target a <b><font color='#199C2C'>type of Sim</font></b> that requires supervision such as a Child, you will find the option under the category <b><font color='#199C2C'>Supervised Customer</font></b>!

      <T n="text">0x78805DBF<!--There are many ways a Small Business can generate profits!\n\nIt can charge an <b><font color='#199C2C'>Entrance Fee</font></b> if the lot has a <b><font color='#199C2C'>Ticket Kiosk</font></b>. This can either be a One-Time fee upon arrival or an Hourly fee.\n\nYou can also earn Simoleons by buying <b><font color='#199C2C'>Retail Displays</font></b> and stocking them with items that customers can buy! This is perfect if you want to sell your paintings, your beautiful pottery or maybe some tasty food.\n\nLastly, the Small Business can also offer <b><font color='#199C2C'>paid services</font></b>, such as offering your customers some custom tattoos or skill classes!--></T>

You can then see the <b><font color='#199C2C'>Area Assignment</font></b> for that room and change it to Public (accessible by customers), Employees Only, or Residential (only accessible by your Sim's household).\n\nOutdoor areas will always be Public. If you want a certain section of your garden to be private, consider using a fence to restrict any unwanted entries!--></T>
