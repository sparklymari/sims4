      <T n="text">0xF138E783<!--Once a Sim dies, their remains can be customized to fit that Sim's personality! By interacting with their current urn or tombstone, you can select <b>Display as...</b> to choose a style for their remains. After that you can go to Build Mode and use the Design Tool to change the swatch of the model, if you'd like.\n\nYou can also <b>Turn On or Off Auto-Switch</b> when interacting with an urn or tombstone. By default, Sim remains placed outdoors will display as tombstones, and change to urns when placed indoors. This is the behavior seen when Auto-Switch is turned on. Turning off Auto-Switch allows you to set either type to stay as, regardless of whether it's placed indoors or outdoors.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xD584A728<!--Gravesites are objects that can be purchased in Build Mode, allowing you to slot Sim remains onto them and decorate them as you see fit. It's a lovely way to honor a loved one that passed with mementos, or a sneaky way to make fun of a deceased not-so-loved one with something they'd hate.\n\nOnce it's placed, you can drag an urn or tombstone onto the plot, which will designate that gravesite for that Sim's remains. You may also place a burial casket on a gravesite, and slot the remains into the casket!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x6DDCD5E5<!--Crypts can be purchased from Build Mode and are also found in each neighborhood of Ravenwood. To add Sim remains, select the Crypt object and choose <b>Urn and Gravestone Inventory</b>, which allows you to drag a Sim's Urn or Gravestone directly into the Crypt.\n\nSims can tell <b>Ghost Stories</b>, <b>Nap</b>, <b>WooHoo</b>, and even embark on adventures when they <b>Explore the Underground Crypts</b>! When exploring, a Sim will disappear inside and can discover valuable rewards while on their quest. However, be warned, creepy encounters with otherworldly beings are also possible when descending into the Crypt.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xC93C4876<!--<b>Memorial Displays</b> are a touching way to honor and remember passed Sims as well. There are two which are available in Build Mode. Just search "Memorial Display" or look for them in the Life Event Activities category. Once placed, select the <b>Memorial Display</b> and choose to Dedicate Memorial Display to either a Household or a specific Sim. If you change your mind, you can always select it again to Remove Memorial Display Dedication. Once dedicated, Sims can interact with the <b>Memorial Display</b> to Reminisce about Deceased or to Talk to.\n\n<b>Memorial Displays</b> can also be decorated. Try placing an Urn of someone who has recently passed, the <b>Whispering Wren Messenger Statue</b> to let your passed loved ones know how your Sims are feeling, some flowers, incense, or the <b>In Loving Memory: A Timeless Capture</b> portrait object. There isn't a wrong way to memorialize your loved ones.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xF09D6521<!--The <b>In Loving Memory: A Timeless Capture</b> portrait object is another special way to commemorate those who have passed, even after they're already gone. Search for it in Build Mode or place it from the Life Event Activities category. Once placed, Sims can interact with it to Update Frame and Flowers. More importantly, they can Assign Sim to Memorial Portrait. They simply need to know someone who recently passed. This will display the passed Sim as they were at the moment of their death. To ensure this image doesn't change, simply select the portrait to Lock it.\n\nWhen paired with a <b>Memorial Display</b> that has already been dedicated or a <b>Gravesite</b> that has an <b>Urn</b> or <b>Tombstone</b> slotted into it, the portrait object will automatically update to the applicable Sim's portrait.\n\nPro Tip: For further customization, photos from your Sim's Inventory can also be dragged into the portrait object at any time as long as it's not currently Locked.--></T>
