      <T n="text">0x9B511FA2<!--<b>Romantic Boundaries</b> control what does or doesn't make Sims experience romantic Jealousy. By default, all Sims experience Jealousy if a partner engages in any kind of romance with other Sims. You can change this!\n\nRomantic Boundaries can be configured in the <b>Identity Panel</b> in Create A Sim. The first three settings control if your Sim experiences Jealousy when a partner engages in certain types of romantic interactions with other Sims. The settings are:\n\n<ul><li><b>Non-physical romance</b>, which is any romance where the Sims' bodies do not touch. These can be found in the <b>Affection and Flirtation</b> categories of the <b>Romance</b> interaction menu when you select another Sim.</li>\n<li><b>Physical romance</b>, under the <b>Physical Intimacy</b> category of the Romance interaction menu. This setting controls Jealousy caused by a partner having romantic physical contact, but <i>does not</i> include Mess Around (Teen Sims) or WooHoo (Adult Sims.)</li>\n<li>The third setting specifically covers <b>Mess Around</b> (for Teen Sims) or <b>WooHoo</b> (for Adult Sims.) These interactions are also found in the Physical Intimacy category.</li></ul>--></T>

      <T n="text">0x4DDCD7A3<!--The last setting says if a Sim is <b>Exploring Romantic Boundaries.</b> If the Sim is exploring, they may reconsider each of the three boundaries listed above, by talking about it with other Sims in Live Mode. If the Sim is not exploring, their boundaries are firm and they cannot be asked to reconsider.\n\nUse these settings to decide how Jealousy does (or doesn't) unfold in Live Mode.
