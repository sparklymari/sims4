      <T n="text">0x2922DC74<!--Fairies can solve all of their Needs in the same way that Non-Occult Sims can. However, they also have other interesting and new ways to help replenish them faster! This excludes <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force.</b></font> (See <font color="#199C2C"><b>Emotional Force</b></font> Lesson)\n\n<font color="#199C2C"><b>Hygiene:</b></font> Fairies can <font color="#199C2C"><b>Cleanse in Nature</b></font> on various plants as long as they are watered, not infested with bugs, and in the Mature or Blossoming stages to fulfill their Hygiene Needs. Whenever a Fairy solves this Need, whether normal sized or shrunk down, they will drop some <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font> in the surrounding area! (See <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font> Lesson)\n\n<font color="#199C2C"><b>Energy:</b></font> Fairies can sleep in all the same places as Non-Fairy Sims, but they can also <font color="#199C2C"><b>Shrink and Sleep</b></font> on Pianos and in Dollhouses (as long as those objects aren't broken) to get some rest!\n\n<font color="#199C2C"><b>Social:</b></font> Fairies can perform a variety of new social interactions such as <font color="#199C2C"><b>Flood with Laughter</b></font> within the Fairy Pie Menu Category to increase their Social Need as well as provide some Fun!--></T>

They can also <font color="#199C2C"><b>Shrink and Play</b></font> on Bookshelves, Ovens, Refrigerators, Stereos, TVs, Trash Cans, Dressers, Storage Objects, Coffee Makers, Bars, Workout Machines, Toy Boxes, Sofas, Loveseats, Recliners, Mailboxes, Fireplaces, Dishwashers, and Kitchen Counters for Fun! Some of these objects will even provide unique benefits to the Fairy when performed!--></T>
