      <T n="text">0x3191D8E6<!--Your Sim's neighbors have <b>Secrets</b> and they're ready to be discovered! There are several ways to discover a Sim's <b>Secrets</b>. Your Sim can choose to Eavesdrop on a neighbor's door or Eavesdrop on conversations between two other Sims. Additionally, Sims can find <b>Secrets</b> by sifting through a Sim's belongings such as bookshelves, computers, mailboxes, or trashcans.\n\nFor a more risky means of uncovering a <b>Secret</b>, your Sim can travel to a neighbor's home and start a Break-In!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x1137024A<!--Break-Ins are a special event where your Sim has the opportunity to break into a neighbor's home, starting with getting that pesky front door opened. Once broken in, your Sim has free reign of the house until the owners return. Feel free to make use of the amenities, but you might also want to opt for <b>Snooping</b> on certain belongings, such as bookshelves, computers, mailboxes, or trashcans. Doing so will allow your Sim to discover <b>Secrets</b> about Sims that live there! Just make sure to keep an eye on the time remaining before the homeowners return, as they will not be very happy to discover someone breaking into their home!--></T>

They can either choose the Friendly route and promise to keep the <b>Secret</b>, or they could choose to be Mean and Blackmail the Sim whose <b>Secret</b> they learned for sweet Simoleons! Though, the Sim with the <b>Secret</b> might not be so happy to have to pay for your silence...--></T>
