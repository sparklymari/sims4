      <T n="text">0x1FBF0DBE<!--The <font color="#199C2C"><b>Coast of Adhmor</b></font> is a bustling seaside village and a great place to meet the locals and learn about the isle's rich history.\n\nCome speak to the local townie Glen Nhoam, who can be found working at <font color="#199C2C"><b>Gnum Gnum's Market Stall</b></font> at the center of the town. Want to shop? Sims can pick up some Groceries at the grocery store <font color="#199C2C"><b>John and Gio's</b></font> next to the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Great Gnome Statue</b></font>, or go to the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Captain's Quarters</b></font> fisherman hut down at the docks for fresh fish.\n\nMosey over to the adjacent dock to learn the history of the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Wreck of the Callyoch</b></font>, the shipwreck just off shore, or check out <font color="#199C2C"><b>The GNOM Exhibit</b></font> Museum that specializes in gnomes.\n\nWhile there is a ton of history in this town, Sims should know that using <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Abilities</b></font> is frowned upon in this neighborhood. If a Sim is caught using Fairy Abilities here, they'll be looked down upon, but rectifying it can be done at the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Mossveil Fairy Hub</b></font> in <font color="#199C2C"><b>Everdew</b></font>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xB9E32F44<!--Sims who want to use their <font color="#199C2C"><b>Natural Living Skills</b></font> will feel right at home in <font color="#199C2C"><b>Sprucederry Grove</b></font>, with its green backdrop, natural water, and flourishing life.\n\nSims wanting to further their skills or career in <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothercary</b></font> will also find a lot to do in this neighborhood. An <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothercary Table</b></font> is easily accessible near <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothecary Todd's Cures & Elixirs</b></font> market stall, where Sims can buy and sell Apothecary items.

Across the way is the garden shop <font color="#199C2C"><b>Clover's Seeds and Supplies</b></font>, where Sims can shop for <font color="#199C2C"><b>Gardening</b></font> and <font color="#199C2C"><b>Tabletop Plant Pot</b></font> Supplies.\n\nThis neighborhood has a dash of mysticism and enchantment as well. Summoning the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Garden Pal</b></font> from the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Glaswood Tree</b></font> can unlock a special Sim that helps with <font color="#199C2C"><b>Gardening</b></font>, or explore the <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Ring</b></font> to get in touch with <font color="#199C2C"><b>Mother Nature</b></font>.--></T>
