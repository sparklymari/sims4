      <T n="text">0xD9B55ED4<!--The <font color="#199C2C"><b>Natural Living Skill</b></font> lets Sims meet their Needs through the natural environment. Natural Living is challenging at first—Sims initially take longer to fulfill their Needs and often get dirty in the process.\n\nWith practice, Sims unlock the means to care for any and all Needs. They will not only get faster and more efficient doing so, but find it just as comfortable and enjoyable as doing it in a conventional home.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x8B150459<!--The following interactions are available to all Sims, aged Child and up, to get started with Natural Living:\n\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Sleeping on the Ground</b></font>: Usable both indoors and outdoors, your Sim will toss and turn and lose some Hygiene, but it's a great way to get started. The most skilled Sims will be able to sleep outdoors in extreme weather and temperatures. <i>(Seasons)</i>\n\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Bathing in Outdoor Water</b></font>: Sims can bathe in any natural water that is deep enough to wade, including rivers, lakes, oceans, and even ponds created on the lot. Outdoor water can get very cold, but with practice, Sims get used to the temperature. <i>(Seasons)</i>\n\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Taking a Sponge Bath in Public Restrooms</b></font>: Sims can take a sponge bath in public restrooms located in the world, as well as the Fairy Hub located in Everdew. Select the restroom building and the interaction will be available.\n\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Foraging</b></font>: Sims can forage on nearly any terrain for useful resources, including food. Skilled Sims will unlock additional foraging options.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x7381E69F<!--More interactions unlock from building Natural Living Skill:\n\n• Level 2, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Summoning a Privy Bush</b></font>: Sims can summon a Privy Bush to relieve Bladder Needs by selecting natural terrain outdoors, such as grass, dirt, or sand. Causes Hygiene loss at low skill, which fades with practice.\n\n• Level 2, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Eat Fish</b></font> and Level 5, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Eat Frogs</b></font>: Select any Fish or Frog in the Sim's inventory and select Eat. Uncomfortable at low level, but feels better (and fills more Hunger) at higher level. Find Frogs by foraging on grassy terrain and by Looking for Frogs in logs. Acquire fish by fishing at Fishing Spots out in the World or shopping at Captain's Quarters.\n\n• Level 5, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Talking to Nature</b></font>: Sims can fulfill their Social Need by selecting any live plant and choosing Talk to Nature.\n\n• Level 7, <font color="#199C2C"><b>Meditating in Nature</b></font>: Select any natural terrain, such as grass, dirt, or sand, and choose to Meditate in Nature. Higher skill regains more Fun and restores some Balance.\n\nAdditional perks: At Level 10, Sims have much lower chance of gaining Fear of the Dark from being outdoors at night, and Fear of Swimming from minor swimming incidents. At Level 6, Sims become immune to extreme temperatures. <i>(Seasons)</i>--></T>

      <T n="text">0xAB84EBF<!--Foraging outcomes may be joyous or not so much, such as finding a Stink Bug at lower Natural Living Skill levels. Having high Natural Living Skill and Good Luck will each increase the chances of better outcomes, including finding some special items!\n\nAll worlds support Foraging, and searching for certain items may have different results depending on which world a Sim Forages in. Sims Foraging around any neighborhood of Innisgreen may find <font color="#199C2C"><b>Everdew Plant Seeds</b></font>. Foraging in the forest neighborhood of Everdew itself may turn up <font color="#199C2C"><b>Fairy Dust</b></font>.\n\nTo have Sims Forage in a group, select another Sim and choose <font color="#199C2C"><b>Actions > Form Group...</b></font> or <font color="#199C2C"><b>Actions > Add to Group</b></font>. Then select any Forageable terrain then choose <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage Here Together</b></font>.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x37C6E77<!--<font color="#199C2C"><b>Foraging</b></font> can be done alone or in a group of Sims! Foraging interactions allow Sims to discover items outdoors in any world and neighborhoods.\nInteractions include:\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage Here</b></font>\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage for Collectibles</b></font>\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage for Apothecary Ingredients</b></font> (unlock at <font color="#199C2C"><b>Apothecary Skill Level 2</b></font>)\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage for Food</b></font>\n• <font color="#199C2C"><b>Forage for Plants</b></font>\n\nForaging builds a Sim's Natural Living Skill and is a great way for a Sim to find food outdoors, in addition to catching Fish and Frogs. The higher the skill level, the better the items Sims will find, and the more Foraging interactions will unlock.\nTo Forage, select any natural terrain outdoors such as grass, dirt, and sand. Sims won't be able to Forage on solid terrain such as stone, cement, or wood.--></T>
