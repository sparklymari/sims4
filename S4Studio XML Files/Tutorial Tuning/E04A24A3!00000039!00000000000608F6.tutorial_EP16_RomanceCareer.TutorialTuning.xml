      <T n="text">0x11E4E5BC<!--Sims have the opportunity to move on to more advanced subjects through two specialized branches.\n\nThe goal of the first branch, <b>Matchmaker</b>, is to bring compatible Sims together to form the ideal marriage. To determine what is important for each client, a Sim will research topics like forms of intimacy and love expressions. They can also dabble in the affairs of others by Suggesting Cupid's Corner or Asking about Recent Dates.\n\nIn addition to centering on relationships, the second branch, <b>Relationship Counselor</b>, also links in <b>Romantic Satisfaction, WooHoo Education, and Relationship Goals</b>. This branch focuses on supporting couples through any trials they may face while providing resources to overcoming and building stronger connections. --></T>
