      <T n="text">0xD0FCFEC4<!--Life as a <b>Property Owner</b> requires diligence and extra care! But you can manage your business completely remotely by taking advantage of the phone or mailbox. Head over to the mailbox to 'Post Fine' for any of the broken rules, or 'Post Rent Demand' for any overdue rent you need to collect. When an event unfolds you can call an expensive or cheap contractor to resolve the problem for you instead!\n\nIf you desire closer relationships with your <b>Tenants</b>, visit the unit! You can do this by selecting the 'Travel to Unit' button on the 'Owned Businesses Panel.' This provides an opportunity for regular inspections and maintenance of the units and shared spaces.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x756B79C3<!--You can become a <b>Property Owner</b> by opening the Owned Businesses panel and selecting Buy Residential Rental. You can buy an empty lot in any world to convert the lot type into a Residential Rental. If you wish to sell your Residential Rental lot, simply select Sell Residential Rental which can be done on the Owned Businesses panel or through Manage Worlds. Selling your lot will not move out the existing households, but will immediately replace them with a new <b>Property Owner</b>. The Owned Businesses Panel will display all of your owned units as well as your home unit if you are a <b>Property Owner</b> living in a Residential Rental.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xBDC4BFD0<!--Once you have created your units or purchased a Residential Rental lot, you can head into the Owned Businesses Panel to Fill Vacancy for the unoccupied units. Before you move in your <b>Tenant</b> households, make sure to set the Lease Length and Rent Per Day of the particular unit. The Max Rent indicates the maximum amount of rent you can charge for the unit. You can also set Unit Rules, which the <b>Tenant</b> Household must abide by. Make sure to set Unit Rules and finalize your Rent Per Day before moving in your Tenants, as altering these lease details after they have already moved in, with exceptions to the Grace Period window, will result in an unsatisfied <b>Tenant</b> household and lower your Unit Ratings.--></T>

In the applications panel, you'll find all the households interested in occupying this unit. Pay close attention to their Beds Wanted count; it's highly recommended to select a household whose preferences match the unit's specifications.\n\nThe <b>Rent Cap</b> represents the maximum rent amount this household can afford. If the set Rent Per Day exceeds the household's Rent Cap, they won't be eligible for moving in. Look for households with green checkmarks in both fields, indicating that they meet the qualifications for moving in.\n\nOnce you've chosen the <b>Tenant</b> household, select the checkmark on the bottom right to immediately move them in!--></T>

      <T n="text">0x4D9C3ACF<!--<b>Unit Rating</b> is important to keep track of as a <b>Property Owner</b>, as it directly affects the unit's ability to attract high-paying <b>Tenants</b> and more Sims will be interested in moving into the unit. A highly rated unit not only benefits <b>Property Owners</b> but also ensures a better quality of life for the <b>Tenants</b>. You can easily track changes in <b>Unit Rating</b> for each unit by observing the dynamically changing up and down arrows displayed on the Owned Businesses panel.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x424B409C<!--Four categories combine to determine the <b>Unit's Rating</b>, where each category has three levels of quality that range from low to high. The following three categories are directly impacted from Build Mode changes:\n\n• <b>Size</b> represents the total number of tiles within the unit. Building a larger unit will result in a higher rating.\n\n• <b>Amenities</b> are determined by the objects placed in the unit and shared spaces. Adding objects from Build Mode, such as beds, toilets, showers/bathtubs, skill/hobby activities, and appliances, will enhance the quality of this category.\n\n• <b>Environment</b> is calculated based on the number of décor objects with an environment attribute placed in the unit. A well-decorated unit will achieve a higher Unit Rating.--></T>
