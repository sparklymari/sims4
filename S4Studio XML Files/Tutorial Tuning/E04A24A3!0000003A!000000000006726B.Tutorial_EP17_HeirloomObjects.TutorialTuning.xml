      <T n="text">0x413C598<!--Heirloom Objects are designated objects that have special value to Sims and may be passed down through generations of Sims via Wills. Many objects are worthy of being Heirloomsâ€”crafted items and artworks, chairs, tables, decorations, and more!\n\nTo designate an Heirloom Object, select an eligible item and choose <b>Make Heirloom</b>. This will designate your current Sim as the original creator of that Heirloom. If inherited, your Heirloom will always commemorate the original creator of the heirloom!--></T>

Once your Sim has a Will created, you can interact with the Heirloom and select <b>Pass on Heirloom to...</b> to open the Heirloom Object inheritance menu. You must then choose a worthy Sim to inherit the object.\n\nThis can also be done by interacting with an existing Will in your Sim's Inventory.
