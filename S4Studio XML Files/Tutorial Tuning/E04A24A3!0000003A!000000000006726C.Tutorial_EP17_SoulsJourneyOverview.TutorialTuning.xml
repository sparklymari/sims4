      <T n="text">0x24A2BEFF<!--The Soul's Journey is a new reward system to guide Sims through the later stages of life, offering self-fulfillment, closure, and even Rebirth! For living Sims, the Soul's Journey becomes available once they reach a young adult, while ghost Sims can start their Soul's Journey early as a teen!\n\nLiving Sims have a Bucket List, that can be filled with goals they hope to fulfill before they die. Ghost Sims will have Unfinished Business, consisting of goals that they're aiming to achieve before moving on. Completing goals from this list will earn your Sim progress through their Soul's Journey track.--></T>
