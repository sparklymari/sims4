      <T n="text">0x247884D0<!--When a Sim experiences a difficult period in their life, <b>Grief</b> may surface. Tough situations, such as <b> Loss of a Family Member or Close Friend</b>, <b>Loss of a Pet</b>, <b>Divorce</b>, or <b>Getting Fired from a Career</b> can be trigger points for a Sim to begin the <b>Grieving Process</b>.\n\nNot all Sims surface Grief in the same way, and not all Sims will gain Grief. It can show itself as <b>Anger</b>, <b>Blues</b>, <b>Denial</b>, or <b>Holding it Together</b>. Each <b>Grief Type</b> comes with its own challenges and opportunities to grow!\n\nWhen a Sim gains Grief from losing a loved one, Grief is often delayed, taking a few days to take hold once the mourning period has ended and those Moodlets have subsided.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x67C271EB<!--A Sim’s <b>Grief Type</b> can be found in the Traits section of the Simology Panel. This is where you'll see whether your Sim has the <b>Anger</b>, <b>Blues</b>, <b>Denial</b>, or <b>Holding it Together</b> Grief Type.\n\nThe Grief Type gained by a Sim is based on Sim Traits and (if applicable) their relationship. For example, Macabre Sims are less likely to gain Grief, and if they do, you will most likely find them with Denial or Holding It Together Grief Types. Grief will have its own set of behaviors for your Sim to navigate.--></T>

      <T n="text">0x7A625330<!--Sims can cope with Grief by engaging in uplifting, creative, or proactive activities. A Sim can <b>Attend Grief Counseling</b>, an interaction found by selecting the grieving Sim.\n\nCertain Sim activities are more helpful in coping with Grief, depending on the Sim’s Grief Type. Specific activities can be found by hovering over the Grief Icon in the Traits section of the Simology Panel.--></T>

      <T n="text">0xFE97F0DD<!--Grief is a journey, and with every path, there are bumps along the way. You’ll notice that <b>Denial</b> and <b>Holding It Together</b> Grief Types have a chance to transition to <b>Anger</b> or <b>Blues</b> during the grieving period, so being proactive about Grief is beneficial to a Sim’s wellbeing.\n\nGrief always finds its way to acceptance eventually. However, it <i>may</i> change a Sim’s personality when all is said and done…either for better or worse, depending on how <b>Grief</b> was dealt with. Dealing with <b>Grief</b> is a natural part of life. With the right support, a Sim can come out stronger on the other side!--></T>
