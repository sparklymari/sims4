One morning, while I was waiting for my order at the coffee shop, the barista called out what I <i>thought</i> was my name. Grabbing the cup, I soon realized I was off by about... 6 letters. But Iâ€™d already taken the coffee, made eye contact with the barista, acknowledging confidently that it was mine. When I returned, she remembered me! Soon everyone at that coffee shop knew me by this false name. And I kept going, and I kept taking this person's coffee. That's when things really flew off the rails. I was recognized in public by this new name. Over time it became hard to differentiate this persona from my real life. What's next, a long lost spouse? Kids?! Who knows! Good coffee, though.--></T>
