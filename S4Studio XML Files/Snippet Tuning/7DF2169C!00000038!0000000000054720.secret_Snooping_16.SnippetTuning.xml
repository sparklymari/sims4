He was a royal pain! One week, I happened to have grilled cheese for lunch a few times. Mr. Cousland came up to me during lunch and told me I should be careful. If I eat too many grilled cheeses, it would change me forever. And he said of all the people he knew, I would be the one most likely to fall down that slippery slope. I scoffed in his face and told him he was full of it, which earned me detention <i>and</i> extra homework. For years, I didn't believe him. Until one day I felt it, after having grilled cheese for lunch, dinner, <i>and</i> a midnight snack, the sensation hit me like a load of bricks. It was calling to me, the golden, glistening, cheesy, crunchy delicacy. Like it was floating in the sky and begging me to fly to it. I wrested control of myself at that moment. But I couldn't believe it, Mr. Cousland was right about grilled cheese, and he was right about me. He knew my weakness, and now so do you.--></T>
