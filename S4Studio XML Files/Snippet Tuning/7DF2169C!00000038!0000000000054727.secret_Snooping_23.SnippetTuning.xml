It was very cute, and she'd even painted a little panther (her favorite animal) on the side of it! One day, I was struck with the inspiration to add something to the painted panther. So I grabbed a nearby pen and added an extra tooth sticking out of its mouth, between the usual 2 fangs. But the thing is, I didn't know how to draw a panther fang, so it looked more like a human tooth. I was so embarrassed! I pretended not to notice it when her mom brewed us some tea. The next time I was at her house, I felt that familiar strike of inspiration, and added another (once again, <i>way</i> too human-looking) tooth sticking out of its mouth. This happened again and again, until the day Ann finally noticed, when the panther looked like it was smiling with a mouth full of human teeth. She screamed in horror, wondering if a ghost had done it. I couldn't bear to tell her the truth. We don't speak anymore, but to this day I shudder to think of how she'd react if she knew it was me!--></T>
