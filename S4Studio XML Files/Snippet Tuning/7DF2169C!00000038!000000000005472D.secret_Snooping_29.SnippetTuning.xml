The other day, I noticed he carries a different color briefcase every day. This seemed odd to me, like who owns that many briefcases? I let curiosity get the better of me, and followed him at a distance after I saw him walk by the next day. We walked for what felt like hours, until finally he dropped the briefcase on a bench in Oasis Springs. I looked, and didn't see anyone else around. So I snatched the briefcase and ran. When I got home, I opened it to find stacks and stacks of Simoleons! That guy must be a really successful criminal! I panicked, and ran as fast as I could, briefcase in hand. I ended up throwing it into the canal in Willow Creek. If anyone finds out, I could get in trouble, or worse, get on the bad side of a local criminal!--></T>
