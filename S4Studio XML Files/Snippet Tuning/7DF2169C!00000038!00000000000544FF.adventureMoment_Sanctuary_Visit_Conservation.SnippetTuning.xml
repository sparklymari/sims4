Here at the Sulea Tiger Sanctuary, tigers are cared for and protected while they roam free in their natural habitat. Our care can be temporary or lifelong depending on the needs of our animals. More often than not, visitors won't even catch a glimpse of one, but you can definitely hear them!--></T>
                        <T>0x2FF4CC43<!--Continuing the population of tigers is a big part of conservation, which is why it's such an exciting time when cubs are born. Guests can even become a part of our Cub Club by donating towards our Adopt-a-Tiger Program!\n\nWhile you won't be able to adopt an <i>actual</i> tiger to bring home, you do get an adorable plushie as a stand-in. Every bit of support helps us monitor and care for the tigers of Tomarang, from the tiniest newborn to the eldest cat!--></T>
                        <T>0x61A2B16C<!--The focus of the Sulea Tiger Sanctuary is not solely on our local tigers. Our efforts span outwards across other regions, seeking to protect similar habitats where tigers can thrive.\n\nWe've had some pretty famous supporters as well, including Judith Ward after she starred in A Tiger Talks. The experience she had on set left her feeling fiercely philanthropic! There's a lovely plaque somewhere thanking her for her donations.--></T>
