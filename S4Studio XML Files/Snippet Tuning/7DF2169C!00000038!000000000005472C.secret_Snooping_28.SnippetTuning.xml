He was fixing something on it, and didn't notice when I toddled my way through the open door on its side. Of course I'd brought my favorite toy with me, and was happily playing with it while tucked away in a little corner. Well, little did I know, this tube was actually a ROCKET SHIP that my astronaut neighbor was tuning up right before his next trip to space. But when the floor started rumbling beneath me, and the light suddenly changed around me, I managed to hop over to the window, and saw myself surrounded by the stars. It was incredible, but I knew I'd get in <b>huge</b> trouble if I was found. So I hid in a different little nook, with a nice view of the window, playing with my toy as I watched the stars and planets soar by. When we finally landed, I managed to sneak my way out and waddle home just in time for dinner. Somehow, no one noticed!--></T>
