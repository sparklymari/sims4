You know, spark some interest with something dangerous and exciting! I didn't know it would get so out of hand. A bigger Cowplant meant more customers, so nightly feedings were a must. It grew and grew, and as it grew, it wanted more. I couldn't supply its demands, so it began EATING customers! It even ate the owner! I knew my Cowplant had to be stopped, so I enlisted help in making sure it was sent to a secret place where it could never hurt another Sim. I couldn't let my Cowplant just take over the world. That was one mean, green monster.--></T>
