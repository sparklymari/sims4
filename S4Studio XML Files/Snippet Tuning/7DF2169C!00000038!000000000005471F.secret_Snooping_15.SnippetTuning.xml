One visit in particular, I saw a small cub stumbling around. At that moment, I knew I wanted to take him home with me. I screamed and kicked and cried, begging for a baby tiger of my own. My parents thought it would be a good idea to get me a pet cat instead. I named him Mr. Tiddlywinks. And he looked just like a tiger! Oh, how I loved him. And then one day, my good 'ol kid brain decided it was time for Mr. Tiddlywinks to return to the forest. Never teach a child Rehabilitation and Release unless you specify you shouldn't do it to your house pets! I like to imagine Mr. Tiddlywinks is living high and mighty these days with his tiger pack. He was a menace, but he was my menace. Just… don’t tell anyone I abandoned my cat in the forest! I was just a kid, I didn’t know any better!--></T>
