The Mysterious Rancher who periodically appears around Chestnut Ridge is also willing to buy!\n\nVarious factors impact how much each bottle of Nectar can sell for. To increase the amount of Simoleons earned from each bottle consider the following:\n• Nectar price increases from Not Yet Aged, to Lightly Aged, to Moderately Aged, and peaks at Finely Aged.\n• Nectar price increases from Poor Quality to Normal Quality, and peaks at Excellent Quality. Try using high quality Ingredients to improve the quality of Nectar.\n• Nectars that require more Nectar Making Skill to craft are worth more. Improve Nectar Making Skill to craft more difficult Nectars.\n• The Mysterious Rancher will pay more money for Nectar than selling it regularly will.--></T>
